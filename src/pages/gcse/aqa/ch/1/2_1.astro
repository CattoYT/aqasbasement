    <h2>Chemical bonds</h2>
    <p>
        - There are three types of strong chemical bonds: ionic, covalent and
        metallic.<br>
        - In Ionic bonds, the positive and negative charges are attracted to each
        other. It can only occur in compounds where metals are combined with non-metals.<br>
        - In Covalent bonds, the electrons are shared between the atoms. It happens 
        in most non-metallic elements and in most non-metal compounds.<br>
        - In Metallic bonds, the electrons are shared between the atoms, but the
        atoms are held together by a network of metal ions. It occurs in metals.

    <br>
    <h2>Ionic bonds</h2>
    <p>
        - Ions are atoms that have a positive or negative charge formed by the 
        gain or loss of electrons.<br>
        - The loss or gain of electrons gives the ion a full outer shell of electrons.<br>
        - A full outer shell needs to have 8 electrons. Metals lose electrons, and 
        non-metals gain electrons.<br>
        - Since most of GCSE only focuses up to Calcium, for our purposes:
        <ul>
            <li>Group 1 elements lose 1 electron</li>
            <li>Group 2 elements lose 2 electrons</li>
            <li>Group 3 elements lose 3 electrons</li>
            <li>Group 4 elements gain 4 electrons</li>
            <li>Group 5 elements gain 3 electrons</li>
            <li>Group 6 elements gain 2 electrons</li>
            <li>Group 7 elements gain 1 electron</li>
            <li>Group 8 elements do not gain or lose electrons</li>
        </ul><br>
        - Negative ions are called anions and form when atoms gain electrons, 
        they have more electrons than protons.<br>
        - Positive ions are called cations and form when atoms lose electrons, 
        they have more protons than electrons.<br>
        - Here's how it's represented (image stolen from spec):<br>
