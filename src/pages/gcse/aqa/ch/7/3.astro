    <h1>7.3 Synthetic and naturally occurring polymers</h1>
    <h2>7.3.1 Addition polymerisation</h2>
    <p>
        - One of the most important ways that chemicals from crude oil 
        are used is to make polymers.<br>
        - Polymers are substances made from very large molecules made up 
        of many smaller repeating units (monomers).<br>
        - Polymers can be natural (e.g. starch, cellulose, proteins) or
        synthetic (e.g. poly(ethene), poly(propene)).<br>
        - Most synthetic polymers are made from monomers that contain
        carbon-carbon double bonds (alkenes).<br>
        - Alkenes can be used to make polymers such as poly(ethene) and
        poly(propene) by addition polymerisation.<br>
        - In addition polymerisation reactions, many small molecules
        (monomers) join together to form very large molecules (polymers).<br>
        - In addition polymers the repeating unit has the same atoms as the
        monomer because no other molecule is formed in the reaction.
