    <h1>7.3 Synthetic and naturally occurring polymers</h1>
    <h2>7.3.1 Addition polymerisation</h2>
    <p>
        - One of the most important ways that chemicals from crude oil 
        are used is to make polymers.<br>
        - Polymers are substances made from very large molecules made up 
        of many smaller repeating units (monomers).<br>
        - Polymers can be natural (e.g. starch, cellulose, proteins) or
        synthetic (e.g. poly(ethene), poly(propene)).<br>
        - Most synthetic polymers are made from monomers that contain
        carbon-carbon double bonds (alkenes).<br>
        - Alkenes can be used to make polymers such as poly(ethene) and
        poly(propene) by addition polymerisation.<br>
        - In addition polymerisation reactions, many small molecules
        (monomers) join together to form very large molecules (polymers), and nothing else.<br>
        - In addition polymers the repeating unit has the same atoms as the
        monomer because no other molecule is formed in the reaction.

    <h3>Equations</h3>
    <p>
        Ethene → Poly(ethene)<br>
        n(CH<sub>2</sub>=CH<sub>2</sub>) → (–CH<sub>2</sub>–CH<sub>2</sub>–)<sub>n</sub>
        <img class="centreimage" src="/images/ch/ethenetopolyethene.png" alt="Ethene to poly(ethene)">
        Propene → Poly(propene)<br>
        n(CH<sub>2</sub>=CHCH<sub>3</sub>) → (–CH<sub>2</sub>–CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)–)<sub>n</sub>
        <img class="centreimage" src="/images/ch/propenetopolypropene.png" alt="Propene to poly(propene)">
    </p>
    <h3>How we use polymers</h3>
    <p>
        - Ethene monomers can be used to make poly(ethene), which is used to make
        plastic bags and bottles.<br>
        - It is cheap, flexible, and strong.<br>
        - Propene monomers can be used to make poly(propene), which is used to make
        ropes, carpets, and crates.<br>
        - It is strong, durable, and has a high melting point.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>7.3.2 Condensation polymerisation</h2>
    <p>
        - Condensation polymerisation involves monomers with <b>two</b> functional groups.<br>
        - This also results in formation of two products: the polymer and a small molecule
        (often water).<br>
        - Therefore, <b>condensation polymerisation</b> is many monomers with two functional 
        groups joined together to make a very long repeating molecule and another small molecule 
        such as H<sub>2</sub>O or HCl.
    </p>
    <h3>An example of a condensation reaction</h3>
    <p>
        methanol + butanoic acid → methyl butanoate + water<br>
        CH<sub>3</sub>OH + CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>COOH → CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>COOCH<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<br>
        <img class="centreimage" src="/images/ch/condensationexample.png" alt="Methanol and butanoic acid to methyl butanoate and water">
        An H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> catalyst is required.
    </p>
    <h3>Polyesters</h3>
    <p>
        - Polyesters are formed from dicarboxylic acids and diols (alcohols with two -OH groups).<br>
        - The -COOH group of the dicarboxylic acid reacts with the -OH group of the diol to form an ester link (-COO-) and a molecule of water.<br>
        - The repeating unit in the polyester contains atoms from both monomers, unlike in
        addition polymerisation where the repeating unit contains only atoms from the monomer.<br>
        - An example of a polyester is poly(ethene terephthalate) (PET), which is made from
        the dicarboxylic acid benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid and the diol ethane-1,2-diol.<br>
        - Polyesters are used to make fibres for clothing and plastic bottles.<br>
        - Here is how to make an example polyester:
        <img class="centreimage" src="/images/ch/polyester.png" alt="Polyester formation">
        (methanediol + ethanedioic acid → poly(methanediol ethanedioate) + water)
        - And another:
        <img class="centreimage" src="/images/ch/polymer2.png" alt="Polyester formation">
        (ethanediol + propanedioic acid → poly(ethanediol propanedioate) + water)
    </p>
    <h3>Polyamides</h3>
    <p>
        - Polyamides are formed from dicarboxylic acids and diamines (amines with two -NH<sub>2</sub> groups).<br>
        - The -COOH group of the dicarboxylic acid reacts with the -NH<sub>2</sub> group of the diamine to form an amide link (-CONH-) and a molecule of water.<br>
        - An example of a polyamide is nylon-6,6, which is made from the dicarboxylic acid
        hexanedioic acid and the diamine hexane-1,6-diamine.<br>
        - Polyamides are used to make fibres for clothing and carpets.<br>
        - Here is how to make an example polyamide:

        (and H<sub>2</sub>O)

    <h2>7.3.3 Amino acids</h2>
    <p>
        <sub>(from spec)</sub><br>
        - Amino acids have two different functional groups in a molecule.<br>
        - Amino acids react by condensation polymerisation to produce
        polypeptides.<br>
        - For example: glycine is H<sub>2</sub>NCH<sub>2</sub>COOH and polymerises to produce the polypeptide:
        <img class="centreimage" src="/images/ch/polypeptide.png" alt="Polypeptide">
        - Different amino acids can be combined in the same chain to produce proteins.
