    <p>
        - Properties of hydrocarbons depend on the size of their molecules.<br>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Boiling Point</b>: Temperature at which the liquid boils 
                or the gas condenses. Bigger size = higher boiling point.</li>
            <li><b>Volatility</b>: The tendency to turn into a gas. Bigger size = lower volatility.</li>
            <li><b>Viscosity</b>: How easily it flows. Bigger size = higher viscosity (thicker).</li>
            <li><b>Flammability</b>: How easily it burns. Bigger size = lower flammability.</li>
        </ul>
        - (dont memorise the boiling points, just for illustration)<br>

    <p>
        - All hydrocarbons have strong covalent bonds between the carbon atoms, 
        but very weak intermolecular forces between the molecules.<br>
        - The more atoms the molecule is made out of, the higher the 
        strength of the intermolecular forces.
    </p>
    <h3>Crude oil</h3>
    <p>
        - Crude oil is a finite resource found in rocks. Crude oil is the remains
        of an ancient biomass consisting mainly of plankton that was buried
        in mud.<br>
        - Crude oil is a mixture of a very large number of compounds. Most of
        the compounds in crude oil are hydrocarbons, which are molecules
        made up of hydrogen and carbon atoms only.<br>
        - Crude oil is mostly made up of alkanes.
    </p>
    <h3>Fractional Distillation</h3>
    <p>
        - Crude oil is separated into hydrocarbons with similar boiling points called fractions.<br>
        - Fractions are mixtures of hydrocarbons with similar physical properties.<br>
        - This process is called fractional distillation.<br>
        - Crude oil is fed into the oven (bottom left of the image) and vapourised to produce a gas, 
        which is then fed into the fractionaiting column.<br>
        - The gas enters the tower that is hot at the bottom and cool at the top.<br>
        - Molecules cool and condense at different heights, as molecules have different boiling points.<br>
        - Smaller molecules are collected higher up the tower.

    <h3>Complete vs Incomplete combustion</h3>
    <p>
        - <b>Complete Combustion</b> is where all the hydrocarbons are burnt in excess oxygen.<br>
        - <code>{"Methane + oxygen -> carbon dioxide + water"}</code><br>
        - <b>Incomplete Combustion</b> is where the hydrocarbons are burnt in limited oxygen.<br>
        - This produces CO (carbon monoxide) instead of CO<sub>2</sub>.<br>
        - Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas. It binds to haemoglobin irreversibly in red blood cells and 
        prevents oxygen from binding.<br>
        - Carbon particulates can also be produced, some of which will be nanoparticles and some will be 
        coarse particles. This is bad for long-term health and can increase the risk of lung diseases.
    </p>
    <h3>Propane Equations</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Complete combusion:</b> 
        <code>C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8(g)</sub> + 5O<sub>2(g)</sub> → 3CO<sub>2(g) </sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(g)</sub></code><br>
        <b>Incomplete combustion (CO):</b>
        <code>C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8(g)</sub> + 3.5O<sub>2</sub>(g) → 3CO<sub>(g)</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(g)</sub></code><br>
        <b>Incomplete combustion (C):</b>
        <code>C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8(g)</sub> + 2O<sub>2</sub>(g) → 3C<sub>3</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(g)</sub></code><br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Cracking</h3>
    <p>
        - Hydrocarbons can be brown down (cracked) to produce smaller more useful molecules.<br>
        - <code>C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>22</sub> → C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub> + C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub> + C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub></code><br>
        - The products made are more useful than the starting hydrocarbons.
