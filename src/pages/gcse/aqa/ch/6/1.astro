    <h1>Chemistry 6.1 Rate of reaction</h1>
    <h2>6.1.1 Calculating rates of reactions</h2>
    <p>
        The rate of a chemical reaction can be found by measuring the
        quantity of a reactant used or the quantity of product formed over
        time:
    </p>
    <img class="centreimage" src="/images/ch/rateofreaction.png" alt="Rate of reaction equations">
    <p>
        - The quantity of reactant or product can be measured by the mass in
        grams, moles, or by a volume in cm<sup>3</sup>.<br>
        - The units of rate of reaction maybe given as g/s, mol/s, or cm<sup>3</sup>/s.

    <h2>6.1.3 Collision theory and activation energy</h2>
    <p>
        - Collision theory states that chemical reactions can occur only when reacting 
        particles collide with each other and with sufficient energy.<br>
        - The minimum amount of energy that particles must have to react is called 
        the activation energy.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>6.1.4 Catalysts</h2>
    <p>
        - Catalysts, while increasing the rate of a reaction, but are <b>not</b> used 
        up during the reaction.<br>
        - This means that the catalyst is still there, unchanged, after the reaction.<br>
        - Different reactions need different catalysts.<br>
        - An example of a catalyst is enzymes in biological systems.<br>
        - Catalysts increase the rate of reaction by providing <b>a different
        pathway for the reaction that has a lower activation energy</b>.

    <img class="centreimagefullwidth" src="/images/ch/catalystsdiagram.png" alt="Catalysis energy profile diagram">
    <p>
        - According to <b>collision theory</b>, a catalyst lowers the activation energy so 
        a greater proportion of collisions result in a successful reaction.<br>
        - The frequency of collisions remains the same.
