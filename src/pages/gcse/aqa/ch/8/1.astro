    <h2>8.1.1 Pure Substances</h2>
    <p>
        - In chemistry, a pure substance is a single element or compound 
        not mixed with any other substance.<br>
        - In science we would not refer to a substance such as milk as pure because 
        it is a mixture of a number of different substances. This is different from everyday 
        language, where a pure substance can mean a substance that has had nothing added to it, 
        so it is unadulterated and in its natural state, eg pure milk.
    </p>
    <h3>Identifying Pure/Impure Substances</h3>
    <p>
        - Pure substances have specific melting and boiling points. These can be 
        used to distinguish pure substances from impure substances.<br>

    <h2>8.1.2 Formulations</h2>
    <p>
        - A formulation is a mixture that has been designed as a useful product. Many products are complex mixtures in which each
        chemical has a particular purpose<br>
        - Formulations are made by mixing the components in carefully measured quantities to ensure 
        that the product has the required properties.<br>
        - Formulations include fuels, cleaning agents, paints, medicines, alloys, fertilisers, and foods.
