    <h1>3.1 Chemical measurements, conservation of mass and the quantitative interpretation of chemical equations</h1>
    <h2>3.1.1 Conservation of mass and balanced chemical equations</h2>
    <p>
        - <b>The law of conservation of mass</b> states that no atoms are lost or made during a
        chemical reaction, therefore the mass of the product equals the mass of the reactants.<br>
        - This means that chemical reactions can be represented by symbol
        equations which are balanced in terms of the numbers of atoms of
        each element involved on both sides of the equation.
    </p>
    <h3>Simple example of balancing equations</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Example 1:</b> Balance the equation for the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to form water.<br>
        Unbalanced:  H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → H<sub>2</sub>O
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 1: Count the number of atoms on each side.<br>
        - Left side: 2 H, 2 O<br>
        - Right side: 2 H, 1 O
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 2: Balance oxygen by putting a 2 in front of H<sub>2</sub>O:<br>
        H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → 2H<sub>2</sub>O
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 3: Now hydrogen is unbalanced (4 on right, 2 on left). Add a 2 in front of H<sub>2</sub>:<br>
        2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → 2H<sub>2</sub>O
    </p>
    <p>
        ✔ Balanced equation: <b>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → 2H<sub>2</sub>O</b>
    </p>
