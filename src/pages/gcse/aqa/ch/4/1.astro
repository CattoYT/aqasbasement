    <h1>4.1 Reactivity of metals</h1>
    <h2>4.1.1 Metal oxides</h2>
    <p>
        - Metals react with oxygen to produce metal oxides. The reactions
        are oxidation reactions because the metals gain oxygen.<br>
        - <b>Oxidation</b> is the gain of oxygen by a substance.<br>
        - <b>Reduction</b> is the loss of oxygen from a substance.
    </p>
    <h3>Iron Example</h3>
    <p>
        - When iron reacts with oxygen, it forms iron oxide (rust).<br>
        - The reaction is: <br>
        4Fe + 3O<sub>2</sub> → 2Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><br>
        - In this reaction, iron is oxidised (gains oxygen).<br>
        - In the opposite reaction: <br>
        2Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> → 4Fe + 3O<sub>2</sub><br>
        iron oxide is reduced (loses oxygen).
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>4.1.2 The reactivity series</h2>
    <p>
        - When metals react with other substances the metal atoms form positive ions.<br>
        - This is because in order to obtain a full outer shell of electrons (8 electrons), 
        metal atoms need to lose electrons.<br>
        - The reactivity of a metal is related to its tendency to form positive ions.<br>
        The reactivity series is a list of metals (and some non-metals) arranged in order of their reactivity,
        from most reactive to least reactive. It helps predict how metals will react with water, acids, and other substances.<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Potassium (most reactive)</li>
            <li>Sodium</li>
            <li>Lithium</li>
            <li>Calcium</li>
            <li>Magnesium</li>
            <li>Carbon (non-metal, included for comparison)</li>
            <li>Zinc</li>
            <li>Iron</li>
            <li>Nickel</li>
            <li>Hydrogen (non-metal, included for comparison)</li>
            <li>Lead</li>
            <li>Copper</li>
            <li>Silver</li>
            <li>Gold</li>
        </ul><br>
        - Metals higher in the series are more reactive and can displace those below them from compounds.
    </p>
    <h3>Reactions of metals with water:</h3>
    <p>
        - Potassium, sodium, and lithium react vigorously with cold water, producing hydrogen gas and a metal hydroxide.<br>
        - Calcium reacts less vigorously with water, forming calcium hydroxide and hydrogen gas.<br>
        - Magnesium reacts very slowly with cold water, but more rapidly with hot water.<br>
        - Zinc, iron, and copper do not react with cold water.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Reactions of metals with dilute acids:</h3>
    <p>
        - Potassium, sodium, and lithium react explosively with dilute acids (these reactions are not usually done for safety reasons).<br>
        - Calcium reacts rapidly with dilute acids, producing hydrogen gas.<br>
        - Magnesium reacts quickly with dilute acids, producing hydrogen gas.<br>
        - Zinc reacts moderately with dilute acids.<br>
        - Iron reacts slowly with dilute acids.<br>
        - Copper does not react with dilute acids.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Deduction from experiments:</h3>
    <p>
        - By observing how quickly metals react with water or dilute acids (e.g., rate of hydrogen gas production), you can deduce their order of reactivity.<br>
        - If a metal displaces another from a solution (e.g., zinc displacing iron from iron(II) sulfate), it is more reactive.
