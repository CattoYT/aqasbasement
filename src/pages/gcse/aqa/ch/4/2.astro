    <h1>4.2 Reactions of acids</h1>
    <h2>4.2.1 Reactions of acids with metals</h2>
    <p>
        - Acids react with some metals to produce salts and hydrogen.<br>
        - acid + metal → salt + hydrogen<br>
        - e.g. hydrochloric acid + magnesium → magnesium chloride + hydrogen<br>
        - These are <b>redox</b> reactions, as the metal is oxidised and acid is reduced.<br>
        - Magnesium, Iron, and Zinc all react with hydrochloric and sulphuric acids.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>4.2.2 Neutralisation of acids and salt production</h2>
    <p>
        - Acids react with bases (e.g. insoluble metal hydroxides and metal oxides) to produce salts and water.<br>
        - acid + base → salt + water<br>
        - e.g. hydrochloric acid + sodium hydroxide → sodium chloride + water<br><br>
        - Acids also react with alkalis (e.g. soluble metal hydroxides) to produce salts and water.<br>
        - acid + alkali → salt + water<br>
        - e.g. sulphuric acid + potassium hydroxide → potassium sulphate + water<br><br>
        - Acids also react with metal carbonates to produce salts, water, and carbon dioxide.<br>
        - acid + metal carbonate → salt + water + carbon dioxide<br>
        - e.g. sulphuric acid + calcium carbonate → calcium sulphate + water + carbon dioxide<br><br>
        - All of these reactions are examples of <b>neutralisation</b>, as the acid is neutralised by the base, alkali, metal oxide, or metal carbonate.
    </p>
    <p>
        The particular salt produced in any reaction between an acid and a base or alkali depends on:
        <ul>
            <li>the acid used (hydrochloric acid produces chlorides, nitric acid produces nitrates, sulfuric acid produces sulfates)</li>
            <li>the positive ions in the base, alkali or carbonate.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>More examples</h3>
    <p>
        - hydrochloric acid + copper oxide → copper chloride + water<br>
        - nitric acid + potassium hydroxide → potassium nitrate + water<br>
        - sulfuric acid + sodium <b>carbonate</b> → sodium sulfate + water + <b>carbon dioxide</b>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>4.2.3 Soluble salts</h2>
    <p>
        <sub>(stolen from spec)</sub><br>
        - Soluble salts can be made from acids by reacting them with solid
        insoluble substances, such as metals, metal oxides, hydroxides or
        carbonates.<br>
        - The solid is added to the acid until no more reacts and
        the excess solid is filtered off to produce a solution of the salt.<br>
        - Salt solutions can be crystallised to produce solid salts.
    </p>
    <h3>How to make pure, dry samples</h3>
    <p>
        - Add the chosen acid to a beaker.<br>
        - Add the solid, insoluble reactant (metal, metal oxide, hydroxide, or carbonate) gradually to the acid, stirring until no more reacts (excess solid remains).<br>
        - Filter the mixture to remove the excess unreacted solid.<br>
        - Heat the filtrate (salt solution) gently to evaporate some water.<br>
        - Leave the solution to cool and crystallise.<br>
        - Filter off the crystals and dry them to obtain pure, dry samples of the soluble salt.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>4.2.4 The pH scale and neutralisation</h2>
    <p>
        - Acids produce hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>) in aqueous solution.<br>
        - Aqueous solutions of alkalis contain hydroxide ions (OH<sup>-</sup>).<br>
        - The pH scale measures how acidic or alkaline a solution is, ranging from 0 to 14.<br>
        - A pH of 7 is neutral, below 7 is acidic, and above 7 is alkaline.<br>
        - The lower the pH, the more acidic the solution (the higher the concentration of H<sup>+</sup> ions).<br>
        - The higher the pH, the more alkaline the solution (the higher the concentration of OH<sup>-</sup> ions).<br>
        - Each change of one pH unit represents a tenfold change in H<sup>+</sup> ion concentration.
    </p>
    <h3>Neutralisation</h3>
    <p>
        - In neutralisation reactions between an acid and an alkali, hydrogen
        ions react with hydroxide ions to produce water.<br>
        - H<sup>+</sup> + OH<sup>-</sup> → H<sub>2</sub>O<br>
        - As the acid is neutralised, the pH of the solution increases towards 7.
    </p>
    <h3>Indicators</h3>
    <p>
        - Indicators are substances that change colour depending on the pH of the solution they are in.<br>
        - Litmus paper turns red in acidic solutions and blue in alkaline solutions.<br>
        - Methyl orange turns red in acidic solutions and yellow in alkaline solutions.<br>
        - Phenolphthalein is colourless in acidic solutions and pink in alkaline solutions.<br>
        - Universal indicator is a mixture of indicators that shows a range of colours depending on the pH of the solution.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>4.2.5 Titrations</h2>
    <p>
        - Titrations are a quantitative method used to determine the concentration of an unknown solution by reacting it with a solution of known concentration.<br>
        - A few drops of indicator are added to the solution being titrated.<br>
        - The titrant (known solution) is added from a burette until the endpoint is reached, indicated by a colour change.<br>
        - The volume of titrant used is measured and can be used to calculate the concentration of the unknown solution.
    </p>
    <h3>Steps for a titration (using strong acids and strong alkalis only)</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Use a pipette to measure a fixed volume of the solution of unknown concentration (either a strong acid: sulfuric, 
                hydrochloric, or nitric acid, or a strong alkali) and transfer it to a conical flask.</li>
            <li>Add a few drops of a suitable indicator (e.g. methyl orange or phenolphthalein) to the conical flask.</li>
            <li>Fill a burette with the solution of known concentration (the titrant: a strong acid or strong alkali) and record the initial volume.</li>
            <li>Slowly add the titrant from the burette to the conical flask, swirling the flask to mix, until the indicator changes colour (the endpoint).</li>
            <li>Record the final volume of the titrant in the burette and calculate the volume used.</li>
            <li>Repeat the titration to obtain concordant results (two or more results within 0.1 cm³ of each other).</li>
            <li>Use the average volume of titrant used to accurately calculate the concentration of the unknown strong acid or alkali.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <b>Note:</b> Only strong acids (sulfuric, hydrochloric, or nitric acid) and strong alkalis are used in these titrations to find reacting volumes accurately.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>4.2.6 Strong and weak acids</h2>
    <p>
        - A strong acid is completely ionised in aqueous solution.<br>
        &Tab;Examples of strong acids are hydrochloric, nitric and sulfuric acids.<br>
        - A weak acid is only partially ionised in aqueous solution.<br>
        &Tab; Examples of weak acids are ethanoic, citric and carbonic acids.<br>
        For a given concentration of aqueous solutions, the stronger an acid, the lower the pH.<br>
        - Strong acids have a higher concentration of H<sup>+</sup> ions than weak acids.<br>
        - The pH of a strong acid is lower than the pH of a weak acid of the same concentration.<br>
        - The pH scale is logarithmic.<br>
        - As the pH decreases by one unit, the hydrogen ion concentration of the solution increases by a factor of 10.<br>
        - For example, HCl (a strong acid) has a pH of 1, and acetic acid (a weak acid) has a pH of about 3.<br>
        - This means that HCl has a hydrogen ion concentration 100 times greater than that of acetic acid.
