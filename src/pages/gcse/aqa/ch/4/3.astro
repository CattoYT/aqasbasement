    <h2>4.3.1 The process of electrolysis</h2>
    <p>
        - When an ionic compound is melted or aqueous, the ions are free to move about within the liquid or solution.<br>
        - These liquids and solutions are able to conduct electricity and are called <b>electrolytes</b>.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some examples of electrolytes are molten lead bromide (PbBr<sub>2</sub>) and aqueous sodium chloride (NaCl).<br>
        - Electrolysis is the process of using electricity to break down an ionic compound into its elements.<br>
        - Passing an electric current through electrolytes causes the ions to move to the electrodes.<br>
        - The positive ions (cations) move to the negative electrode (cathode) and the negative ions (anions) move to the positive electrode (anode).<br>
        - Ions are discharged at the electrodes producing elements (substances formed of just one type of atom).

    <h3>Writing half equations</h3>
    <p>
        - Half equations show the reactions at each electrode during electrolysis.<br>
        - At the cathode, reduction occurs (gain of electrons).<br>
        - At the anode, oxidation occurs (loss of electrons).<br>
        - To write a half-equation: identify the ion at the electrode, decide whether it is reduced (gains e<sup>-</sup>)
        or oxidised (loses e<sup>-</sup>), add electrons to balance charge and then balance atoms.<br>
        - Electrons appear on the left for reduction (cathode) and on the right for oxidation (anode).<br>
        - Example &ndash; molten lead(II) bromide:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pb<sup>2+</sup> + 2 e<sup>-</sup> → Pb  (cathode, reduction)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 Br<sup>-</sup> → Br<sub>2</sub> + 2 e<sup>-</sup>  (anode, oxidation)<br>
        - Example &ndash; aqueous sodium chloride (NaCl):<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cathode (water reduced): 2 H<sub>2</sub>O + 2 e<sup>-</sup> → H<sub>2</sub> + 2 OH<sup>-</sup><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anode (chloride oxidised): 2 Cl<sup>-</sup> → Cl<sub>2</sub> + 2 e<sup>-</sup><br>
        - When combining half-equations, multiply so the electrons cancel, then add the half-equations to give the overall reaction.
