    <h1>Poetry (Power and Conflict)</h1>
    <h2>Ozymandias</h2>
    <h3>Key Themes</h3>
        The Transience of Power:
        <ul>
            <li>The poem illustrates how power is temporary. Ozymandias, once a mighty king, is now reduced to ruins.</li>
            <li>The inscription on the pedestal, "Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!" is ironic, as it contrasts his past glory with his current state of decay.</li>
        </ul>
        Hubris and Arrogance:
        <ul>
            <li>Ozymandias embodies the arrogance of rulers who believe they can achieve immortality through their deeds.</li>
            <li>His boastful claims highlight the folly of assuming that human achievements can withstand the test of time.</li>
        </ul>
        Nature vs. Human Ambition:
        <ul>
            <li>The vast desert surrounding the statue symbolizes nature's dominance over human endeavors.</li>
            <li>The poem suggests that nature ultimately outlasts human creations, emphasizing the futility of trying to control or defy it.</li>
        </ul>
        The Inevitable Decline of Civilisations:
        <ul>
            <li>The remnants of the statue serve as a reminder that all civilisations, no matter how powerful, will eventually fall.</li>
            <li>Shelley's depiction of the shattered visage reflects the decline of Ozymandias's empire and the impermanence of human legacy.</li>
        </ul>
        Artistic Interpretation and Legacy:
        <ul>
            <li>The sculptor's ability to capture Ozymandias's "sneer of cold command" suggests that art can convey deeper truths about power and character.</li>
        </ul>
        The poem raises questions about how history remembers leaders and the legacies they leave behind.

                    The irony lies in the fact that all that remains of his empire is a ruined statue in the desert. 
                    The reference to 'Mighty' is referring to god: he is challenging the divine authority.</td>

                <td>The use of "chartered" suggests that the streets are "organised" and supposedly "civilised". This represents the government (authority)'s oppression and control - 
                    an organised map represents a predetermined life path.</td>

                <td>The repetition of "every" emphasises the universality of suffering and oppression in society. 
                    The phrase "mind-forg'd manacles" suggests that the constraints on individuals are not just physical but also mental - the mind has forged its own traps 
                    due to brainwashing by authority. This also links to hopelessness and alienation: the cries are not being answered.</td>

                <td>"Plagues the marriage hearse"</td>
                <td>Juxtaposition - marriage is a symbol of love and union, yet it is plagued by death and decay. Society is disorganised and uncontrolled - 
                    disease is still prevalent despite chartered streets, symbolising that the civilisedness of the streets are a facade. In addition to this, marriage is often seen as the 
                    precursor to starting a family - this creates the sense that any babies born are simply born to die or have their lives stripped away by the system.</td>
