    <h1>Poetry (Power and Conflict)</h1>
    <h2>Ozymandias</h2>
    <h3>Key Themes</h3>
        The Transience of Power:
        <ul>
            <li>The poem illustrates how power is temporary. Ozymandias, once a mighty king, is now reduced to ruins.</li>
            <li>The inscription on the pedestal, "Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!" is ironic, as it contrasts his past glory with his current state of decay.</li>
        </ul>
        Hubris and Arrogance:
        <ul>
            <li>Ozymandias embodies the arrogance of rulers who believe they can achieve immortality through their deeds.</li>
            <li>His boastful claims highlight the folly of assuming that human achievements can withstand the test of time.</li>
        </ul>
        Nature vs. Human Ambition:
        <ul>
            <li>The vast desert surrounding the statue symbolizes nature's dominance over human endeavors.</li>
            <li>The poem suggests that nature ultimately outlasts human creations, emphasizing the futility of trying to control or defy it.</li>
        </ul>
        The Inevitable Decline of Civilisations:
        <ul>
            <li>The remnants of the statue serve as a reminder that all civilisations, no matter how powerful, will eventually fall.</li>
            <li>Shelley's depiction of the shattered visage reflects the decline of Ozymandias's empire and the impermanence of human legacy.</li>
        </ul>
        Artistic Interpretation and Legacy:
        <ul>
            <li>The sculptor's ability to capture Ozymandias's "sneer of cold command" suggests that art can convey deeper truths about power and character.</li>
        </ul>
        The poem raises questions about how history remembers leaders and the legacies they leave behind.

            <tr>
                <td>"I met a traveller from an antique land"</td>
                <td>This creates ambiguity, mystery, and intrigue. It also uses unreliable narration, as the story is told through the traveller's perspective, not the writer.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>"A shattered visage lies"</td>
                <td>This imagery evokes a sense of decay and ruin, highlighting the inevitable decline of all leaders and empires. This contrasts with the fact that 
                    Ozymandias was one of the greatest pharaohs of his time.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>"The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed"</td>
                <td>The sculptor captured Ramesses's cruel facial expression: cruelty is what remains of his legacy.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>"My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings: Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!"</td>
                <td>This proclamation emphasizes the theme of hubris, as Ozymandias believes his achievements are unparalleled. 
                    The irony lies in the fact that all that remains of his empire is a ruined statue in the desert. 
                    The reference to 'Mighty' is referring to god: he is challenging the divine authority.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>"Colossal Wreck [...] lone and level sands stretch far away."</td>
                <td>The kingdom has returned to sand. This emphasises the transience of power and the inevitable decline of all leaders and empires: nature will prevail and 
                    human empires are insignificant.</td>
