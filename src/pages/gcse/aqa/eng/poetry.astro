    <h1>Poetry (Power and Conflict)</h1>
    <h2>Ozymandias</h2>
    <h3>Key Themes</h3>
        The Transience of Power:
        <ul>
            <li>The poem illustrates how power is temporary. Ozymandias, once a mighty king, is now reduced to ruins.</li>
            <li>The inscription on the pedestal, "Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!" is ironic, as it contrasts his past glory with his current state of decay.</li>
        </ul>
        Hubris and Arrogance:
        <ul>
            <li>Ozymandias embodies the arrogance of rulers who believe they can achieve immortality through their deeds.</li>
            <li>His boastful claims highlight the folly of assuming that human achievements can withstand the test of time.</li>
        </ul>
        Nature vs. Human Ambition:
        <ul>
            <li>The vast desert surrounding the statue symbolizes nature's dominance over human endeavors.</li>
            <li>The poem suggests that nature ultimately outlasts human creations, emphasising the futility of trying to control or defy it.</li>
        </ul>
        The Inevitable Decline of Civilisations:
        <ul>
            <li>The remnants of the statue serve as a reminder that all civilisations, no matter how powerful, will eventually fall.</li>
            <li>Shelley's depiction of the shattered visage reflects the decline of Ozymandias's empire and the impermanence of human legacy.</li>
        </ul>
        Artistic Interpretation and Legacy:
        <ul>
            <li>The sculptor's ability to capture Ozymandias's "sneer of cold command" suggests that art can convey deeper truths about power and character.</li>
        </ul>
        The poem raises questions about how history remembers leaders and the legacies they leave behind.

                <td>The repetition of "every" emphasises the universality of suffering and oppression in society. 
                    The phrase "mind-forg'd manacles" suggests that the constraints on individuals are not just physical but also mental - the mind has forged its own traps 
                    due to brainwashing by authority. This also links to hopelessness and alienation: the cries are not being answered.</td>

                    disease is still prevalent despite chartered streets, symbolising that the civilisedness of the streets are a facade. In addition to this, marriage is often seen as the 
                    precursor to starting a family - this creates the sense that any babies born are simply born to die or have their lives stripped away by the system.</td>

                    It reflects his need for control and his inability to see her as an independent individual. He gets jealous when anyone else

                <td>"In his darkroom he is finally alone with spools of suffering set out in ordered rows"</td>
                <td>This imagery captures the photographer's isolation and detachment from the subjects of his photographs,
                    highlighting the contrast between the chaotic realities of war and the controlled environment of the darkroom. "spools of suffering" 
                    is a sibilant metaphor that helps ilustrate this. In addition, the ordered rows are a bit like a graveyard, suggesting the death and 
                    destruction that the photographer has witnessed. In addition addition, this could also represent a mass for the dead, like a ritual - 
                    the photographer is taking developing seriously, as if it is a reverential ceremony.</td>

                <td>Solutions to war "slop" as if discarded: this is unceremonious, in contrast to the first stanza. Furthermore, this line is relevant more generally - 
                    often, the people in power do not listen and cause <a href="https://youtu.be/rG_Ue3t17l0?t=168" target="_blank">unjust suffering.</a></td>

                <td>Looking at the photos of the dead body, he remembers who is not in the photo. This highlights just how much is not important to most people, 
                    and how the photographer feels a duty to show the reality of war, even if it is uncomfortable.</td>

                <td>This shows the loss in humanity of these situations - the reduction of individual suffering to mere statistics or images for consumption. 
                    95 out of the 100 agonies will be completely lost, never even shown to most people.</td>

                <td>"The reader's eyeballs prick with tears between the bath and pre-lunch beers [...] and they do not care."</td>
                <td>This line highlights the fleeting nature of empathy in a world desensitised to suffering. The contrast between the mundane 
                    activities of the reader and the profound pain captured in the photographs underscores a societal apathy towards the realities of war. 
                    The newspaper will be read by middle-class people in England, and describing it as "between the bath and the pre-lunch beers" contrasts 
                    the luxuries of their lives with those of people who live in war zones. Most people will only be sad for a bit, eventually forgetting about 
                    the suffering depicted in the photographs.</td>
