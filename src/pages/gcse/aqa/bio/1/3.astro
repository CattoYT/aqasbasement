    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Concentration gradient:</b> The higher the concentration gradient the
        faster the rate of diffusion (as there are more molecules).<br>
        <b>Net Movement:</b> The average direction of particle movement. 0 = fully diffused.
    </p>
    <p>
        Diffusion is the net movement of particles from an area of higher
        concentration to an area of lower concentration, down a concentration
        gradient.<br>
        No energy is required as it is a passive process.<br>
        Happens in gases and solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Particles are always moving around randomly. If there happens to be more
        particles in one area than another, then there tends to be a net
        movement of particles from the area of higher concentration to the area
        of lower concentration.

    <h3 id="factors-that-affect-the-rate-of-diffusion">
        Factors that affect the rate of diffusion
    </h3>
    <p>Factors which affect the rate of diffusion are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            the difference in concentrations (concentration gradient) (more
            spread out = slow diffusion)
        </li>
        <li>the temperature (higher temperature = faster diffusion)</li>
        <li>
            the surface area of the membrane (higher surface area = faster
            diffusion)
        </li>
        <li>
            the surface area of the particles (higher surface area = <i>slower</i> diffusion)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="diffusion-in-living-organisms">Diffusion in Living Organisms</h3>
    <p>
        Some of the substances transported in and out of cells by diffusion are
        oxygen and carbon dioxide in gas exchange, and of the waste product urea
        (the waste part of urine) from cells into the blood plasma for excretion
        in the kidney.
    </p>
    <p>
        Substances have to pass through the cell membrane to
        enter passively.
    </p>
    <p>
        In your body, Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide are passed
        into and out of your cells through diffusion.
    </p>
    <p>
        A single-celled organism has a relatively large surface area to volume
        ratio. This allows sufficient transport of molecules into and out of
        the cell to meet the needs of the organism.

    <h2 id="4-1-3-2-osmosis">4.1.3.2 Osmosis</h2>
    <p>
        Keywords: <b>Osmosis, Water potential, hypotonic, hypertonic, partially
        permeable membrane</b><br>
        FSL: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqe2NhQt8bY">GCSE Biology Revision &quot;Osmosis&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Osmosis:</b> The diffusion of water from a dilute solution to a concentrated
        solution through a partially permeable membrane, down a water concentration
        gradient.<br>
        <b>Water Potential:</b> This is the potential energy of water
        in a system compared to pure water, when both temperature and pressure are
        the same. It measures how freely water molecules can move in a particular
        environment and is represented by the Greek letter Psi (Ψ). Water moves from
        areas of higher water potential (less negative) to areas of lower water potential
        (more negative).<br>
        <b>Partially Permeable Membrane:</b> A membrane that
        allows small molecules like water to pass through but prevents larger solutes
        from moving across.<br>
        <b>Hypotonic Solution:</b> A hypotonic solution
        has a lower concentration of solutes compared to the inside of a cell. This
        causes water to enter the cell, which can lead to swelling and, in extreme
        cases, bursting of the cell.<br>
        <b>Hypertonic Solution:</b> A hypertonic solution has a higher concentration of 
        solutes compared to the inside of a cell. This causes water to leave the cell, 
        leading to shrinkage or shrivelling of the cell.
    </p>
    <h3 id="practical-applications-of-osmosis">
        Practical Applications of Osmosis
    </h3>
    <p>
        <b>In Animal Cells</b>: If the external solution is too dilute
        (hypotonic), water enters the cell, causing it to swell and potentially
        burst (lysis). If the external solution is too concentrated
        (hypertonic), water leaves the cell, causing it to shrink (crenation).
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>In Plant Cells:</b> Plant cells become turgid when water enters, increasing
        pressure against the cell wall, which prevents bursting. In a concentrated
        solution, plant cells become flaccid and may undergo plasmolysis, where the
        cell membrane pulls away from the cell wall.
    </p>
    <p>
        Osmosis is used to make sure that these processes do not occur by
        regulating the movement of water in and out of the cell.

    <h2 id="4-1-3-3-active-transport">4.1.3.3 Active Transport</h2>
    <p>
        Keywords: <b>Root hair cells, active transport, protein transport molecules</b><br>
        FSL: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXTi5tbnOr0">GCSE Biology Revision &quot;Active Transport&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Root hair cells:</b> Root hair cells are specialised cells in the roots
        of plants. They have long, thin extensions (root hairs) that increase the
        surface area of the root, allowing for more efficient absorption of water
        and minerals from the soil.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Active transport:</b> Active transport is the movement of substances across
        a cell membrane from a region of low concentration to a region of high concentration,
        using energy. This energy usually comes from ATP (adenosine triphosphate).
        Unlike diffusion, which is passive, active transport requires energy because
        it moves substances against the concentration gradient.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Protein transport molecules:</b> Protein transport molecules are molecules
        found in cell membranes that help move substances, such as ions, sugars,
        and amino acids, across the membrane. They facilitate both passive transport
        (without energy) and active transport (with energy), ensuring that necessary
        molecules get in and out of the cell efficiently.
    </p>
    <h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
    <p><b>In Plant Cells:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Uptake of Mineral Ions in Roots:</b> Plants use active transport to
            move minerals like nitrates from the soil into their root hair cells,
            even when the concentration of minerals is higher inside the cell than
            in the soil.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Transport of Sugars in the Phloem:</b> Sugars, like sucrose, are actively
            transported into the phloem (transports organic compounds during photosynthesis)
            to be moved around the plant, especially from leaves to other parts of
            the plant that need energy.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>In Animal Cells:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Absorption of Glucose in the Small Intestine:</b> Glucose is actively
            transported from the gut into the bloodstream, even when its concentration
            in the gut is lower than in the blood.
        </li>

        Keywords: <b>Surface Area to Volume Ratio</b><br>
        FSL (sorta, this is still helpful): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHGWH3NdAjc">GCSE Biology Revision &quot;Surface Area to Volume Ratio&quot;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Surface Area to Volume Ratio:</b> The surface area to volume ratio (SA:V)
        is calculated by dividing the surface area of an object by its volume. A
        higher SA:V means that diffusion will be easier.
    </p>
    <p>
        The bigger organisms get, the harder it is to rely on active and passive
        processes to happen (diffusion, osmosis and active transport).
    </p>
    <p>
        As an organism increases in size, their surface area to volume ratio
        gets smaller. This would mean gases and food would not reach every cell,
        and metabolic waste cannot be removed fast enough to stop the waste
        poisoning the cells.
    </p>
    <h3 id="adaptations">Adaptations</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Having a large surface area for maximum exchange rate (e.g. small
            intestine).
        </li>
        <li>
            A thin membrane for a short diffusion pathway (e.g. alveoli in the
            lungs, fish with gills).
        </li>
        <li>
            An efficient blood supply (single or double circulatory system) to
            maintain a steep concentration gradient (e.g. your bloodstream).
        </li>
        <li>
            Ventilation helps maintain a steep concentration gradient for oxygen
            to diffuse in and carbon dioxide to diffuse out (only in organisms
            with lungs, e.g. breathing).
