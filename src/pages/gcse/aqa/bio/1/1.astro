        <b>Eukaryotes: </b> are cells that have a nucleus and other organelles, and are distinguished from prokaryotes by the presence of a nucleus.<br>
        <b>Prokaryotes: </b> are cells that lack a nucleus and other organelles, and are distinguished from eukaryotes by the absence of a nucleus.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        - Plant and animal cells (eukaryotic cells) have a cell membrane,
        cytoplasm and genetic material enclosed in a nucleus.<br>
        - Bacterial cells (prokaryotic cells) are much smaller in comparison. They
        have cytoplasm and a cell membrane surrounded by a cell wall. The
        genetic material is not enclosed in a nucleus. It is a single DNA loop and
        there may be one or more small rings of DNA called plasmids.

    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Nucleus:</b> The control center of the cell, containing the cell's DNA and regulating gene expression and cell division.<br>
        <b>Cytoplasm: </b> The jelly-like substance within the cell membrane that contains all organelles and cell parts. It is the site for most cellular activities.<br>
        <b>Cell membrane: </b> A selectively permeable barrier that surrounds the cell, controlling the movement of substances in and out of the cell. In animal cells, 
        this is the outermost layer of the cell.<br>
        <b>Ribosomes: </b> The sites of protein synthesis in the cytoplasm. They are made up of RNA and proteins.<br>
        <b>Mitochondria: </b> The sites of cellular respiration in animal cells. They convert glucose into ATP (energy the cell can use). 
        Cells that require more energy have more of them.<br>
        <b>Chloroplasts: </b> The sites of photosynthesis in plant cells. They contain chloropyll, and  
        they convert light energy into chemical energy.<br>
        <b>Cell wall: </b> The outermost layer of a plant cell. It is made up of many different types of materials, primarily cellulose, 
        and keeps the cell's stucture.<br>
        <b>Vacuole: </b> A large, central organelle in plant cells. It stores nutrients and waste products in 
        the form of cell sap, and maintains turgor pressure against the cell wall.
