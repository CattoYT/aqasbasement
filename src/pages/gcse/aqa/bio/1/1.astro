        <b>Eukaryotes: </b> are cells that have a nucleus and other organelles, and are distinguished from prokaryotes by the presence of a nucleus.<br>
        <b>Prokaryotes: </b> are cells that lack a nucleus and other organelles, and are distinguished from eukaryotes by the absence of a nucleus.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        - Plant and animal cells (eukaryotic cells) have a cell membrane,
        cytoplasm and genetic material enclosed in a nucleus.<br>
        - Bacterial cells (prokaryotic cells) are much smaller in comparison. They
        have cytoplasm and a cell membrane surrounded by a cell wall. The
        genetic material is not enclosed in a nucleus. It is a single DNA loop and
        there may be one or more small rings of DNA called plasmids.
