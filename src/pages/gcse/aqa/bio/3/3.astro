    <h2>3.3.1 Detection and identification of plant diseases</h2>
    <p>
        - Plants can be infected with bacterial and viral pathogens, just like humans 
        (for examples see <a href="../1/">3.1</a>)<br>
        - Plants can also be infected with insects, for example aphids.
        <ul>
            <li>They are small insects that feed on sap and breed quickly</li>
            <li>The stylet (long sharp mouthpiece) pierces the phloem</li>
            <li>This deprives plants of sugars needed for respiration</li>
            <li>This can weakend the sap and cause dwarf version of plants and stunt growth</li>
            <li>This can act as vectors for diseases as aphids can carry plant diseases</li>
            <li>Pesticides and releasing natural predators (such as ladybirds) can be used to control aphids</li>
        </ul>
        - Another example of an insect is a nematode worm:
        <ul>
            <li>They live in the soil and feed on plant roots</li>
            <li>This means that less water and mineral ions are taken in by the plant (due to less roots)</li>
            <li>This also reduces the growth of the plant</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Non-communicable diseases in plants</h3>
    <p>
        - These are most commonly found in plants that don't recieve enough mineral ions.<br>
        - If plants are deficient in a mineral fertiliser can be added to the soil to address this.<br>

    <h3>Detecting plant diseases</h3>
    <p>
        <i>taken directly from spec</i><br>
        Plant diseases can be detected by:
        <ul>
            <li>Stunted growth</li>
            <li>Spots on leaves</li>
            <li>Areas of decay (rot)</li>
            <li>Growths</li>
            <li>Malformed stems or leaves</li>
            <li>Discolouration</li>
            <li>The presence of pests</li>
        </ul>
        Identification can be made by:
        <ul>
            <li>Reference to a gardening manual or website</li>
            <li>Taking infected plants to a laboratory to identify the pathogen</li>
            <li>Using testing kits that contain monoclonal antibodies</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>3.3.2 Plant Defences</h2>
    <p>
        - Plants have evolved a number of defences against pests and diseases.<br>
        - These can be divided into physical, chemical and mechanical defences.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Physical defences</h3>
    <p>
        - Physical defences prevent microbial pathognes entering undamaged plants, 
        for example the cellulose cell wall, the waxy cuticle, and bark.
        <Table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Name</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Cellulose cell wall</td>
                    <td>The cell wall is a tough layer of cellulose that, as well as giving 
                        plant cells structure, protects the plant from pests and diseases.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Cuticle</td>
                    <td>The tough waxy cuticle on plant leaves also stops cells from becoming infected.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Bark</td>
                    <td>Many plants are covered with a thick bark. This is an external layer of dead cells which 
                        forms a physical barrier against infection, a bit like our skin.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </Table>
    </p>
    <h3>Mechanical defences</h3>
    <p>
        - Often to deter grazing animals like herbivores. Thorns and hairs deter animals, 
        leaves which droop or curl when touched stop them being eaten, and mimicry tricks animals.
        <Table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Name</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Thorns and hairs</td>
                    <td>Plants like roses have evolved large thorns to avoid being eaten, 
                        while plants like cacti have evolved thin spines. 
                        These adaptations protect plants from damage and keep their vital
                        water stores safe.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Drooping Leaves</td>
                    <td>The Mimosa pudica plant is very special. It has evolved to close 
                        its leaves and then point its stems towards the ground when touched
                        by an insect as it lands on it, making it difficult for the insect 
                        to feed on the leaves.
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Mimicry</td>
                    <td>Mimicry
                        Some plants have evolved the ability to mimic what is around them. 
                        The passion flower vine has evolved small yellow spots on its leaves. 
                        These look like the eggs left behind by butterflies. Female 
                        butterflies are unable to tell the difference between these and real eggs, 
                        so they lay eggs on other leaves to avoid competition when they 'might' 
                        turn into caterpillars. Therefore, the passion flower vine suffers less 
                        damage to its leaves from feeding caterpillars.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </Table>
    </p>
    <h3>Chemical defences</h3>
    <p>
        - Many plants taste unpleasant for herbivores, which cause death to pathogens/insects 
        (e.g. caffeine, nicotine, and cocaine, poisons, and antibacterial chemicals).
        <Table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Name</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Drugs</td>
                    <td>Some plants produce drugs that are toxic to herbivores, or produce undesired 
                        effects that they may learn from and stop eating the plants.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Poisons</td>
                    <td>Other plants, like stinging nettles, have developed poisons to stop themselves 
                        being eaten by herbivores. These do not defend plants from infection by pathogens.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Antibacterial chemicals</td>
                    <td>Some plants such as mint and witch hazel produce antibacterial chemicals. 
                        These limit the spread of bacteria that were not stopped by physical defences. 
                        These chemical defences are now used in antiseptics for humans.</td>

    <h2>Changing surface area</h2>
    <p><i>(I don't know why we do this now but I need to put this somewhere)</i></p>
    <p>
        - When the environment is hot and dry plants lose water faster.<br>
        - It is therefore important to reduce the surface area so they lose less water or store 
        water in their tissues, with some plants doing both.

            <tr>
                <td>Cacti</td>
                <td>Some plants like cacti have broad leaves with a large surface area.
                    The leaves collect dew at night and funnel the water towards the base 
                    of the plant to the root system. The leaves then close during the daytime 
                    to reduce water loss.</td>

                <td>Ferns</td>
                <td>Some plants like ferns have curled leaves to reduce the surface area.
                    The leaves trap a layer of moist air around the leaf to reduce the amount
                    of water that the plant loses through evaporation. </td>

                    The leaves on this plant are actually part of the stem. 
                    The stem has far fewer stomata so loses a lot less water. </td>
