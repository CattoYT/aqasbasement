    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Health: </b> Not just an absence of disease, but a state 
        of physical and mental wellbeing.<br>
        <b>Communicable Disease:</b> A disease that can be transmitted, caused by
        pathogens.<br>
        <b>Pathogen:</b> A disease-causing microorganism. Either directly damages 
        your cells (like viruses) or via toxins (like bacteria).<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        There are four types of pathogens:
        <ul>
            <li>Bacteria: e.g. UTI/STIs (humans)</li>
            <li>Viruses: HIV (humans); tobacco mosaic virus (plants)</li>
            <li>Fungal Spores: Ringworm (humans); potato blight (plants)</li>
            <li>Protists: Malaria (humans)</li>
        </ul><br>
        Viruses and fungi cause the majority of communicable diseases in plants.<br>
        Bacteria and viruses cause the mahority of communicable diseases in humans.
    </p>
    <h3>Viruses</h3>
    <p>
        - Viruses inject their DNA into the nucleus into a cell and hijack it to 
        produce copies of itself. It eventually bursts open, spreading the viruses 
        everywhere, making you feel ill.<br>
        - They are very small (much smaller than a cell) so it makes infection easier.<br>
        - Viruses <i>aren't actually alive</i>, as they cannot reproduce on their 
        own and need a host. Therefore you cannot kill a virus, only destroy it.
    </p>
    <h3>Bacteria</h3>
    <p>
        - Bacteria are living organisms. They are cells themselves, and they reproduce 
        via binary fission (a type of cell division). They are small, but not 
        as small as viruses.<br>
        - Antibiotics kill bacteria, and they can get their own viruses.<br>
        - Not all cause bad diseases, plenty of bacteria are beneficial to you 
        (e.g. some aid in digestion).
    </p>
    <h3>Bacteria vs Viruses</h3>
    <p>
        When bacteria and viruses are in the body, they reproduce rapidly. 
        Bacteria produce poisons called toxins. These toxins damage body cells 
        and result in negative symptoms.<br>
        In comparison, viruses invade the cells of the body. They live 
        and reproduce inside the cells. These cells will burst, releasing 
        copies of the virus to invade other body cells.<br>
        Symptoms include rashes, high temperature and headache: a 
        response of the body.
    </p>
    <h3>Protists</h3>
    <p>
        - Protists are a living type of microorganism that are reliant on a host 
        (they are parasites).
    </p>
    <h3>Modes of transmission</h3>
