        <b>Arteries:</b> Transport blood away from the heart to the rest of the body. Usually at high pressure.<br>
        <b>Veins:</b> Transport blood from the rest of the body back to the heart. They have valves 
        to prevent blood from flowing the wrong way. Usually at low pressure.<br>
        <b>Capillaries:</b> The smallest blood vessels, they are responsible for the 
        exchange of oxygen and nutrients between the blood and tissues. They are a single layer 
        of endothelial cells, which minimise the diffusion distance for oxygen and carbon dioxide. 
        They also have pores that allow blood plasma to leak out and form tissue fluid. They link artieries 
        to veins.

    <h3>Structure of Blood Vessels</h3>
    <p>
        - The walls of each type of blood vessel relate to the function of the vessel.<br>
        - Blood flows through the lumen of a blood vessel; the artieries have thicker walls 
        and have a smaller lumen, the veins have thinner walls and a larger lumen.<br>
        - The walls of the vessels are made of collagen, smooth muscle, and elastic fibres. 
        The fibres allow expansion and recoil which allows the vessels to push blood along, 
        which (in artieries) maintains a high blood pressure.

    <h3>Double Circulatory System</h3>
    <p>
        <sub>(bing chat wrote some of this our teacher skipped a bunch and im low on time)</sub><br>
        - The double circulatory system is a type of blood circulation system in which 
        blood passes through the heart twice during each complete circuit around the body.<br>
        - This system is essential for efficiently transporting oxygen and nutrients to cells 
        and removing waste products.<br>
        - It works in two stages:
        <ul>
            <li>
            Pulmonary Circulation:
                Deoxygenated blood is pumped from the right side of the heart to the lungs.
                In the lungs, the blood releases carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen.
                The oxygenated blood then returns to the left side of the heart.
            </li>
            <li>
            Systemic Circulation:
                The left side of the heart pumps the oxygenated blood to the rest of the body.
                As the blood travels through the body, it delivers oxygen and nutrients to tissues and collects carbon dioxide and other waste products.
                The deoxygenated blood returns to the right side of the heart, completing the circuit.
            </li>
        </ul>
        - It is required because the body needs to maintain a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients; 
        without it our blood would become too acidic.
