    <p>
        - Plants require mineral ions and water from the soil.<br>
        - Water enters root hair cells using osmosis.<br>
        - Mineral ions enter root hair cells using active transport.<br>
        - Mineral ions dissolve in water which moves through the xylem vessel.<br>
        - Products of photosyntehsis are glucose and oxygen.<br>
        - These products are used for aerobic respiration.<br>
        - Products of photosynthesis (collectively cell sap) reach all 
        parts of the plant via the phloem vessel.

        - Xylem and ploem tissues form vascular bundles. These are in: 
        <ul>
            <li>Root: Vascular bundles in the centre of the root. This 
                resists forces that could pull the plant ot of the ground.</li>
            <li>Stem: Vasular bundles near the edge of the stem. Phloem is on the 
                outside and xylem on the inside. Resists bending caused by the wind.</li>
        </ul>
