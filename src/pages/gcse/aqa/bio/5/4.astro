    <h1>5.4 Plant hormones</h1>
    <h2>5.4.1 Control and coordination</h2>
    <p>
        FSL: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Bf5WKEMB5o">GCSE Biology Revision "Plant hormones"</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        - Plants produce hormones to coordinate and control growth and
        responses.<br>
        - Phototropism is response to light.<br>
        - Gravitropism or geotropism is response to gravity.<br>
        - Hydrotropism is response to water.<br>
        - Shoots are positively phototropic and negatively gravitropic (grow
        towards light and away from gravity).<br>
        - Roots are negatively phototropic, positively hydrotrophic, and positively gravitropic (grow
        away from light and towards water and gravity).<br>
        - Ethene controls cell division and ripening of fruits.
    </p>
    <h3>Auxin</h3>
    <p>
        - Auxin is a plant hormone that controls growth near the tips of shoots
        and roots.<br>
        - They are made in the meristem.<br>
        - Auxin stimulates growth in shoots and inhibits growth in roots.<br>
        - In shoots, more auxin accumulates on the shaded side, causing the
        cells there to elongate faster. This makes the shoot bend towards the
        light.<br>
        - In roots, more auxin accumulates on the lower side, inhibiting cell
        elongation there. This makes the root bend downwards.
    </p>
    <h3>Phototropism</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>The light hits the plant shoot</li>
            <li>Auxin will diffuse from the tip</li>
            <li>It will acculumate on the dark side</li>
            <li>Cells on the dark side elongate faster</li>
            <li>The shoot grows and bends towards the light</li>
        </ol>

    <h3>Germination</h3>
    <p>
        - In roots the side with LESS auxins grow more, causing the root to grow downwards.<br>
        - In shoots the side with MORE auxins grow more, causing the shoot to grow upwards.<br>
        - This is important for seed germination, as the shoot needs to grow
        upwards to reach the light for photosynthesis, and the root needs to
        grow downwards to reach the water and minerals in the soil.<br>
        - It knows which direction to grow in because of gravity.<br>
        - Gibberellins are important in initiating seed germination.<br>
        - They stimulate the seed to break dormancy and start germination.

    <h2>Required practical activity 8: investigate the effect of light or gravity on the growth of newly
    germinated seedlings</h2>
    <p>
        - Set up a Petri dish with moist filter paper or cotton wool and place germinated cress seeds (~20) on it.<br>
        - Shine a light from one side and observe the growth of the seedlings over a few days.<br>
        - Measure the angle of growth (with a protractor) and the 
        length of the seedlings (with a ruler) each day to see how they
        respond to the stimulus.<br>
        - Record your observations and draw conclusions about the
        effect of light or gravity on seedling growth.<br>
        - Ensure to control variables such as the type of seed, the
        amount of water, amount and type of nutrients, and the temperature to ensure a fair test.<br>
        - Repeat the experiment several times to ensure reliability and calculate 
        an average (mean) growth angle and length for each condition.<br>
        - Risks: Glass Petri dishes can break, so handle with care. 
        Wash hands after handling seeds and soil to avoid any potential contamination. 
        Hold the lamp by its stand to avoid electrocution risk if there are any holes in the insulation.
