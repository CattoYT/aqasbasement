        - There are multiple receptors in the human nervous system that detect changes in the environment.
        <ul>
            <li><b>Eyes</b> detect light</li>
            <li><b>Skin</b> detects touch, pressure, pain, and changes in temperature</li>
            <li><b>Ears</b> detect sound and changes in body position for balance</li>
            <li><b>Nose and tongue</b> are sensitive to chemicals for smell and taste</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>How the nervous system works</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>A noticeable change in the environment happens (<b>stimulus</b>)</li>
            <li>The stimulus is detected by <b>receptors</b></li>
            <li>The <b>coordinator</b> (central nervous system [brain and spinal cord]) receives the impulse, 
                starting in a <b>sensory neurone</b>, travelling through <b>relay neurons</b> (which are also in the 
                brain) and makes a decision</li>
            <li>The CNS coordinates <b>Effectors</b>: Skeletal muscles contract or 
                glands secrete hormones to cause a response, and this impulse is recieved from a <b>motor neurone</b>.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>Types of neurons</h3>

    <p>
        - The terminals on a motor neurone would usually connect to a muscle or gland.

    <h3>Exam Question</h3>
    <p>
        Explain what happens in your nervous system when you see a piece of fruit and pick it up. [6 marks]<br>
        - The piece of fruit is a stimulus.<br>
        - Sensory receptors in the eyes detect the reflection of light off of the piece of fruit.<br>
        - An electrical impulse travels along the sensory neurone through 
        relay neurons to the CNS.<br>
        - The CNS processes the impulse and decides to move muscles to 
        picks up the fruit.<br>
        - To do this, the CNS sends signals through relay neurons, which eventually 
        reach the muscles' motor neurones, which send signals to the muscles.<br>
        - The muscles contract to pick up the fruit.<br>
        - The effector is the skeletal muscle.
