    <h3>The endocrine system</h3>
    <p>
        - The endocrine system is made up of glands that secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream.<br>
        - The bloodstream carries the hormone.<br>
        - <b>The hormone</b> binds to receptors on the cell membrane of its target organ (like how a virus binds to a receptor on a cell).<br>
        - This produces an <b>effect</b>.
    </p>
    <h3>Glands</h3>
    <p>
        The glands you need to know for GCSE are;
        <ul>
            <li>Pituitary gland (located in the brain)</li>
            <li>Adrenal glands (on top of the kidneys)</li>
            <li>Pancreas (behind the stomach)</li>
            <li>Thyroid gland (in the neck)</li>
            <li>Gonads (ovaries in females and testes in males)</li>
        </ul>
        Each of these glands secretes specific hormones that regulate various bodily functions.<br>
        The pituitary gland in the brain is a 'master gland' which secretes hormones in response to
        body conditions. These hormones act on other glands to stimulate other hormones to be
        released to bring about effects.
    </p>
    <h3>Sexual characteristics</h3>
    <p>
        - There are primary and secondary sexual characteristics.<br>
        <Table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Primary</th>
                    <th>Secondary</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What a person is born with</li>
                            <li>Ovaries for females, testes for males</li>
                            <li>Produces the sex hormones</li>
                        </ul>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Triggered by sex hormones</li>
                            <li>Breast/penis growth</li>
                        </ul>
                    </td>
                </tr>

    <h2>5.3.2 Control of blood glucose concentration</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77oyUdNZ054">GCSE Biology Revision "Control of blood glucose concentration"</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        - <b>Glucose</b>: The sugar used in respiration<br>
        - <b>Glycogen</b>: A storage carbohydrate found in the liver in muscles.<br>
        - <b>Glucagon</b>: A hormone that stimulates the liver to break down glycogen to glucose.
    </p>
    <h3>The Pancreas</h3>
    <p>
        - Blood glucose concentration is monitored and controlled by the pancreas.<br>
        - It is an organ and a gland (secrets hormones into the bloodstream).<br>
        - It is a coordinator as it makes descisions (whether to secrete insulin or glucagon).<br>
        - When blood sugar levels rise it releases insulin:
        <ol>
            <li>Receptors on the pancreas detect rise in glucose in the bloodstream.</li>
            <li>Pancreas produces <b>and releases</b> insulin into the bloodstream.</li>
            <li>Insulin makes cell membranes more permeable by glucose, so <b>more</b> glucose is taken 
            up by cells.</li>
            <li>Liver converts and stores the excess glucose into glycogen.</li>
            <li>Blood glucose will decrease.</li>
        </ol>
        - When blood sugar levels fall it releases glucagon:
        <ol>
            <li>Receptors on the pancreas detect <b>fall</b> in glucose in the bloodstream.</li>
            <li>Pancreas produces and releases glucagon into the bloodstream.</li>
            <li>Glucagon causes glycogen stored in the liver and muscles to be broken down into glucose.</li>
            <li>Fats and amino acid are broken down.</li>
            <li>Blood glucose increases.</li>
        </ol>
