    <h3>The endocrine system</h3>
    <p>
        - The endocrine system is made up of glands that secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream.<br>
        - The bloodstream carries the hormone.<br>
        - <b>The hormone</b> binds to receptors on the cell membrane of its target organ (like how a virus binds to a receptor on a cell).<br>
        - This produces an <b>effect</b>.
    </p>
    <h3>Glands</h3>
    <p>
        The glands you need to know for GCSE are;
        <ul>
            <li>Pituitary gland (located in the brain)</li>
            <li>Adrenal glands (on top of the kidneys)</li>
            <li>Pancreas (behind the stomach)</li>
            <li>Thyroid gland (in the neck)</li>
            <li>Gonads (ovaries in females and testes in males)</li>
        </ul>
        Each of these glands secretes specific hormones that regulate various bodily functions.<br>
        The pituitary gland in the brain is a 'master gland' which secretes hormones in response to
        body conditions. These hormones act on other glands to stimulate other hormones to be
        released to bring about effects.
    </p>
    <h3>Sexual characteristics</h3>
    <p>
        - There are primary and secondary sexual characteristics.<br>
        <Table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Primary</th>

                            <li>Ovaries for females, testes for males</li>
                            <li>Produces the sex hormones</li>

                            <li>Breast/penis growth</li>

    <h2>5.3.2 Control of blood glucose concentration</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77oyUdNZ054">GCSE Biology Revision "Control of blood glucose concentration"</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        - <b>Glucose</b>: The sugar used in respiration<br>
        - <b>Glycogen</b>: A storage carbohydrate found in the liver in muscles.<br>
        - <b>Glucagon</b>: A hormone that stimulates the liver to break down glycogen to glucose.
    </p>
    <h3>The Pancreas</h3>
    <p>
        - Blood glucose concentration is monitored and controlled by the pancreas.<br>
        - It is an organ and a gland (secrets hormones into the bloodstream).<br>
        - It is a coordinator as it makes descisions (whether to secrete insulin or glucagon).<br>
        - When blood sugar levels rise it releases insulin:
        <ol>
            <li>Receptors on the pancreas detect rise in glucose in the bloodstream.</li>
            <li>Pancreas produces <b>and releases</b> insulin into the bloodstream.</li>
            <li>Insulin makes cell membranes more permeable by glucose, so <b>more</b> glucose is taken 
            up by cells.</li>
            <li>Liver converts and stores the excess glucose into glycogen.</li>
            <li>Blood glucose will decrease.</li>
        </ol>
        - When blood sugar levels fall it releases glucagon:
        <ol>
            <li>Receptors on the pancreas detect <b>fall</b> in glucose in the bloodstream.</li>
            <li>Pancreas produces and releases glucagon into the bloodstream.</li>
            <li>Glucagon causes glycogen stored in the liver and muscles to be broken down into glucose.</li>
            <li>Fats and amino acid are broken down.</li>
            <li>Blood glucose increases.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>Diabetes</h3>
    <p>
        - Diabetes is a disease where the body cannot effectively control blood glucose concentration.<br>
        - There are two main types:
    </p>
    <h4>Type 1 Diabetes</h4>
    <p>
        - Usually starts in childhood/teenage years.<br>
        - Caused by the pancreas failing to produce enough insulin (immune system destroys insulin-producing cells).<br>
        - Blood glucose levels can rise to dangerous levels after eating.<br>
        - Treated by:
        <ul>
            <li>Regular insulin injections.</li>
            <li>Careful diet (avoiding large sugar intakes).</li>
            <li>Regular exercise to lower blood sugar.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Type 2 Diabetes</h4>
    <p>
        - Usually develops later in life (often linked to obesity, lack of exercise, and genetic risk).<br>
        - Body cells stop responding properly to insulin (insulin resistance).<br>
        - Blood glucose levels remain high after meals.<br>
        - Treated by:
        <ul>
            <li>Careful diet (low sugar, controlled carbohydrate intake).</li>
            <li>Regular exercise.</li>
            <li>Drugs that help the body respond to insulin / reduce blood glucose.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>5.3.4 Hormones in human reproduction</h2>
    <p>
        - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXswGsfeHJg">GCSE Biology Revision "The Menstrual Cycle"</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        - The menstrual cycle is regulated by four main hormones:
        <ul>
            <li>FSH: follicle-stimulating hormone; produced by the pituitary gland</li>
            <li>LH: luteinizing hormone; produced by the pituitary gland</li>
            <li>Oestrogen: the main female reproductive hormone. Produced by the ovaries</li>
            <li>Progesterone: Produced by the ovaries; maintains uterus lining.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Stages of the menstrual cycle</h3>
    <p>
        - Day <b>1</b>: FSH is secreted, this leads to the egg maturing in the ovary.<br>
        - Day <b>1</b>-6: Menstruation - uterus lining breaks down.<br>
        - Day <b>5</b>-7: FSH stimulates ovaries to produce oestrogen. As levels rises, this inhibits FSH production.
        Oestrogen stimulates repair of uterus lining.<br>
        - Day <b>7</b>-13: Profliteration - repair of the uterus lining.<br>
        - Day <b>14</b>: Oestrogen stimulates LH release. Oestrogen levels drop. 
        LH causes ovulation - mature egg released from the ovary.<br>
        - Day <b>15</b>+: The empty egg follicle stimulates the release of Progesterone.
        Progesterone maintains uterus lining. Potential pregnancy.<br>
        - Day <b>28</b> (well, 26-32): Menstruation starts again if no pregnancy.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
        - Fertility can be controlled by a variety of hormonal and non-hormonal methods of contraception.

    <h2>5.3.6 The use of hormones to treat infertility</h2>
    <p>
        People may have difficulty conceiving (getting pregnant) for various reasons, including:
        <ul>
            <li>Lack of female hormones (FSH, LH)</li>
            <li>Damage to oviducts</li>
            <li>Lack of sperm</li>
            <li>Eating disorders</li>
            <li>Age</li>
            <li>pretty much no reason!</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Lack of ovulation</h3>
    <p>
        - Some females do not release FSH, so eggs do not mature.<br>
        - Treatment is FSH injections to stimulate the egg to mature, then LH injections to 
        simulate the egg's release.
    </p>
    <h3>IVF</h3>
    <p>
        - There are four main steps to IVF:
        <ol>
            <li>Mother is given FSH and LH to stimulate the maturation and release of multiple eggs.</li>
            <li>Eggs are collected from the mother.</li>
            <li>Father provides a sperm sample, and the eggs are fertilised in the lab by ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection).</li>
            <li>Fertilised eggs (embryos) are grown in the lab for a 2-5 days, then one or two are implanted into the mother's uterus.</li>
            <li>After 12 to 14 days a pregnancy test is given to see if successful.</li>
        </ol>
        - IVF can be expensive and emotionally stressful, and it does not always result in a successful pregnancy.<br>
        - There are also ethical issues surrounding the use of IVF, such as the fate of unused embryos.<br>
        - It also has the risk of multiple births if more than one embryo is implanted.
    </p>
    <h2>5.3.7 Negative feedback</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Mts354VC7A">GCSE Biology Revision "Negative Feedback"</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        - Negative feedback is a control system that maintains conditions of the internal environment of the body.<br>
        - It keeps them within an optimal (narrow) range, any movement away from this range is detected and reversed.<br>
        - Blood glucose levels and body temperature are controlled by negative feedback.<br>
        - When the level of a substance gets too high or too low, negative feedback brings it back to normal.
    </p>
    <h3>Thyroxine</h3>
    <p>
        - The thyroid gland produces thyroxine which regulates the basal metabolic rate, development of the brain, 
        growth, oxygen use in tissues, and protein synthesis.<br>
        - The release of thyroxine is controlled by a negative feedback system involving the pituitary gland.<br>
        - When thyroxine levels are low, the pituitary gland releases thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 
        which stimulates the thyroid gland to produce more thyroxine.<br>
        - When thyroxine levels are high, the pituitary gland reduces the release of TSH, which decreases the production of thyroxine.<br>
        - Iodine, found in food, is required to produce thyroxine.<br>
        <img class="centreimage" src="/images/bio/thyroxineloop.png" alt="Thyroxine negative feedback diagram">
    </p>
    <h3>Adrenaline</h3>
    <p>
        - NOT negative feedback: no feedback loop.<br>
        - The adrenal glands produce adrenaline which is used to prepare the body for 'fight or flight' in times of stress or danger.<br>
        - Adrenaline increases heart rate, breathing rate, and blood flow to muscles, and it also increases blood glucose levels by 
        stimulating the breakdown of glycogen to glucose in the liver.<br>
        - The release of adrenaline is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system, which is activated in response to stress or danger.
    </p>
    <h3>Worked exam questions</h3>
    <h4>Compare the role of thyroxine in the body and the way it is controlled with the role
        and control system for adrenaline. (4 marks)</h4>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Thyroxinie controls the body's metabolic rate and growth and development.</li>
            <li>It is controlled in a negative feedback loop.</li>
            <li>Adrenaline, by contrast, increases heart rates and breathing rates, triggers pupil dilation, 
                and triggers the conversion of glycogen to glucose in the liver.</li>
            <li>Adrenaline is not controlled by a negative feedback loop; it is released in response to stress or danger.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Describe how a negative feedback system works. (4 marks)</h4>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>If a factor in the internal environment increases, this is detected by receptors.</li>
            <li>Changes take place to decrease it back to its original devel.</li>
            <li>Conversely, if a factor in the internal environment decreases, changes take place to increase it
                back to its original level.</li>
            <li>For example, if blood glucose levels rise, insulin is released to lower it; 
                if blood glucose levels fall, glucagon is released to raise it.</li>
        </ul>
