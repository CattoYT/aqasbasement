        - <b>Food security</b> is having enough food to feed a population.<br>
        - Sustainable methods must be found to feed all people on Earth.<br>
        - These biological factors affect food security:

            <tr>
                <td>Changing diets in developed countries</td>
                <td>This means scarce food resources are transported around the world to feed 
                    richer countries, which may lead to food shortages in poorer countries. This 
                    is especially problematic because rich countries eat more meat, which takes 
                    a lot more land and resources to produce.</td>

    <h2>7.5.2 Farming techniques</h2>
    <p>
        FSL: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrbJl3R4YJU">GCSE Biology Revision "Modern Farming Techniques"</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        - The efficiency of food production can be improved by restricting energy transfer from 
        food animals to the environment. This can be done by limiting their movement and by 
        controlling the temperature of their surroundings.<br>
        - As these are the two main energy uses in respiration, reducing them means there is 
        more energy available for growth.<br>
        - Some animals are fed high protein foods to increase growth.
    </p>
    <h3>Ethical concerns</h3>
    <p>
        - Animals are often raised in confined spaces, such as small cages.<br>
        - While this is more efficient, it can lead to stress and disease.<br>
        - 'Free range' farming is a more ethical approach, where animals are raised in large 
        spaces and are allowed to roam free.<br>
        - <i>(sidenote: When buying animal products, I would always go for free-range, not "battery" farmed as it's often called).</i>
    </p>
    <h3>Other techniques</h3>
    <p>
        - Other techniques include:
        <ul>
            <li>Antibiotics in food: This reduces disease, however can cause antibiotic resistance.</li>
            <li>Monocultures: This is when a single crop is grown in a field, to maximise food produced per area. This reduces biodiversity 
                and often sucks nutrients from the soil, so something new should be grown every year in rotation.</li>
            <li>Fertiliser use: This is the use of chemicals to increase the growth of plants. This can be done by adding nitrogen, phosphorus, 
                and potassium to the soil. Runoff can occur from fertiliser use, polluting waterways and harming aquatic life.</li>
            <li>Hedgerow removal: This is the removal of hedgerows, which are trees that grow in the shade of the surrounding land. This 
                makes it easier to farm with machinery, but reduces biodiversity.</li>
        </ul>
