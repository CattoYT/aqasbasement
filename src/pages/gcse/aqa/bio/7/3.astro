    <h1>7.3 Biodiversity and the effect of human interaction on ecosystems</h1>
    <h2>7.3.1 Biodiversity</h2>
    <p>
        FSL: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5UR9uMeWuQ">GCSE Biology Revision "Biodiversity"</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        - <b>Biodiversity</b> is defined as the variety of all the different species
        of organisms on earth, or within an ecosystem.<br>
        - Different species may depend on each other for survival. This can be in
        multiple ways:
        <ul>
            <li>Food</li>
            <li>Habitat (e.g. shelter, nesting sites)</li>
            <li>
                Physical environment (e.g. temperature, water availability. most
                common with trees (e.g. roots))
            </li>
        </ul>
        - Good biodiversity is where there are multiple organisms that can fulfill
        the requirements of other organisms.<br>
        - This ensures the stability of ecosystems by reducing the dependence of
        one species on another for food, shelter and the maintenance of the physical
        environment.<br>
        - The future of the human species on Earth relies on us maintaining a good
        level of biodiversity.<br>
        - We rely on other organisms for many different things, including:
        <ul>
            <li>Food: Crops, fruits, meat, pollinators, etc.</li>
            <li>Habitat: Forests, grasslands, deserts</li>
            <li>Physical environment: Water, air, soil, temperature</li>
        </ul>
        - Many human activities are reducing biodiversity and only recently have
        measures been taken to try to stop this reduction.
    </p>

    <h2>7.3.2 Waste Management</h2>
    <p>
        FSL: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z405uGDZGo">GCSE Biology Revision "Waste Management"</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        - Rapid growth in human population and the resulting increase in demand
        for food and resources has led to a significant increase in waste.<br>
        - Unless waste and chemicals are managed properly, they can end up in landfills,
        oceans, rivers, and the atmosphere.<br>
        - This is collectively <b>pollution</b>.<br>
        - Pollution can occur:
        <ul>
            <li>In water (sewage, fertiliser, toxic chemicals, oil spills)</li>
            <li>In air (smoke, acidic gases)</li>
            <li>On land (landfill, toxic chemicals)</li>
        </ul>
        - Waste management is the process of reducing, reusing, and recycling waste.<br>
        - It is important to manage waste properly to reduce the amount of waste
        that ends up polluting the environment.

    <h2>7.3.3 Land Use</h2>
    <p>
        FSL: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfJsDfm5BXE&t=28s">GCSE Biology Revision "Land Use"</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        - Humans reduce the amount of land available for other animals and
        plants by building, quarrying, farming and dumping waste.<br>
        - This reduces biodiversity because it reduces the amount of habitat available
        and interrupts food chains and webs, so there is less prey for animals.<br>
        - Examples of land use include:
        <ul>
            <li>Agriculture: Farming, grazing, and crops.</li>
            <li>Forestry: Logging, cutting down trees, and wood.</li>
            <li>Urbanisation: Buildings, roads, and other infrastructure.</li>
            <li>Mining: Extracting minerals from the earth.</li>
            <li>Industry: Manufacturing, mining, and construction.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Peat Bogs</h3>
    <p>
        - Peat bogs are destroyed mainly due to: 
        <ul>
            <li>Peat Extraction – Peat is removed for use as fuel or as a 
                component of compost in gardening.</li> 
            <li>Agriculture – Some peatlands are drained to create farmland.</li>
            <li>Development – Peatlands are destroyed to make space for roads, 
                buildings, or infrastructure.</li>
            <li>Climate Change – Warmer temperatures and changes in rainfall 
                can dry out peat bogs, making them more vulnerable.</li>
        </ul>
        - Effects of Peat Bog Destruction:
        <ul>
            <li>Increased Carbon Dioxide (CO₂) Emissions: Peat stores large amounts of carbon.
                When peat is burned or decomposes after being drained, CO₂ is 
                released, contributing to global warming.</li>
            <li>Loss of Biodiversity: Peat bogs are habitats for rare plants, insects, and birds. 
                Their destruction leads to a decline in species that depend on them.</li>
            <li>Flooding Risk: Peatlands act like sponges, absorbing rainwater. Their destruction 
                increases the risk of flooding in nearby areas.</li>
            <li>Soil Erosion: Once peatlands dry out, the soil becomes loose and easily washed away, 
                reducing fertile land.</li>
        </ul>
        - Solutions:
        <ul>    
            <li>Using peat-free compost</li>
            <li>Protecting and restoring peatlands</li>
            <li>Reducing land drainage</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>7.3.4 Deforestation</h2>
    <p>
        - Large-scale deforestation in tropical areas has occurred to:
        <ul>
            <li>Provide land for cattle and rice fields</li>
            <li>Grow crops for biofuels</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Consequences of deforestation include:
        <ul>
            <li>Loss of biodiversity</li>
            <li>Climate change (more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere)</li>
            <li>Soil erosion (trees help stabilise soil; leaching nutrients from the soil)</li>
            <li>Water pollution</li>
            <li>Loss of habitat for wildlife</li>
            <li>Increased risk of natural disasters</li>
            <li>Flooding (loose topsoil falls into rivers)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        - Levels of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere are increasing, 
        and contribute to ‘global warming’.

                and despite being phased out in the largest 
                international agreement ever (this is a whole rabbit hole)
                CFCs are still being released into the atmosphere from old refrigerating systems.</td>

    <h3>How Global Warming Works</h3>
    <p>
        The greenhouse effect is the process by which heat is trapped in the Earth's atmosphere, 
        keeping the planet warm enough to support life. It is a natural phenomenon, but 
        human activities have intensified it, leading to global warming.<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Sunlight Reaches Earth – The Sun emits shortwave radiation (mainly visible light and ultraviolet rays), 
                which passes through the Earth's atmosphere.</li>
            <li>Earth Absorbs and Re-emits Heat – The Earth's surface absorbs this energy and warms up.
                It then emits infrared radiation (heat) back into the atmosphere.</li>
            <li>Greenhouse Gases Trap Heat – Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere preventing it from escaping into space.</li>
            <li>Earth Stays Warm – This trapped heat keeps the planet at an average temperature of around 15°C, which is essential for life.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Consequences of Global Warming</h3>
    <p>
        - Rising sea levels<br>
        - More extreme weather events<br>
        - Loss of biodiversity (food chains and habitats are disrupted)<br>
        - Increased risk of natural disasters<br>
        - Increase in species migration (animals seek cooler climates; this leads to an increase in pests in colder regions)
