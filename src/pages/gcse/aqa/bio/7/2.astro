    <p>
        <b>Decomposer:</b> A decomposer is an organism that breaks down other organisms. 
        Examples include fungi and bacteria.<br>
        <b>Detritivore: </b> Detritivores are decomposers that feed on dead organisms.
        Examples include worms and insects.
    </p>
    <h3>Factors Affecting Decomposition</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Moisture: </b> Moisture is required for feeding and reproduction.<br>
        <b>Oxygen: </b> Oxygen is required for aerobic respiration.<br>
        <b>pH/Temperature: </b> The correct pH and temperature is required for enzymes 
        to work at their optimum.

    <h3>Decay of Milk</h3>
    <p>
        - Milk is mixed with an indicator (turns pink).<br>
        - When lipase is added, this breaks down the fats in the milk into fatty 
        acids and glycerol.<br>
        - The indicator turns yellow to indicate the end of the reaction.<br>
        - Repeat until <abbr title="results in agreement">concordant</abbr> results 
        are obtained.

    <h3>Uses of Decomposition</h3>
    <h4>Compost</h4>
    <p>
        - Gardeners and farmers need optimum conditions so their waste material 
        decays more quickly.<br>
        - Compost is a mixture of decomposers and organic 
        matter that is used to improve soil fertility, and is made of this waste.<br>
        - This means that recycling of organic waste is done, as new plants 
        can draw minerals from the compost.
    </p>
    <h4>Biogas Generators</h4>
    <p>
        - Some decomposers can break down material without oxygen (anaerobically).<br>
        - This produces methane gas, which is (pretty much) the same thing 
        as natural gas. Natural gas produced in this way is also known as biogas.<br>
        - The methane can then either be burned to produce electricity, or 
        used in the natural gas industry.
