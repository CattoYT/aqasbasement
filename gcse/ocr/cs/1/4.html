        <h1>1.4 - Network Security</h1>
        <h2>Forms of attack</h2>
        <p>
            - There are many forms of attack on networks, but the most common 
            (and the ones you need to know about) are:  
            <ul>
                <li>Malware</li>
                <li>Denial of service attacks</li>
                <li>Brute force attacks</li>
                <li>Social engineering attacks</li>
                <li>SQL injection attacks</li>
                <li>Data interception attacks</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Malware</h3>
        <p>
            - Malware is malicious software that is designed to damage or 
            disrupt a computer system, or to gain unauthorised access to a 
            computer system.<br>
            - It can be spread through a variety of methods, including 
            email attachments, infected websites, and infected software.<br>
            - Oftentimes if you are being careless and, for example, running random 
            scripts without precautions, you are more likely to be infected with 
            malware.<br>
            - Malware tends to delete, corrupt, or modify files and data, 
            and can also be used to gain unauthorised access to a computer 
            system (or make it part of a botnet, which is a network of infected
            computers often used to carry out DDoS attacks).
            <table>
                <thead>
                  <tr>
                    <th>Malware</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                  </tr>
                </thead>

                  <tr>
                    <td>Trojan horse</td>
                    <td>A Trojan horse (or simply trojan) is a piece of malware that looks like a legitimate program, but is actually a program that has been designed to do malicious things.</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>Virus</td>
                    <td>A virus is a piece of malware that can replicate itself within the hosts's computer.</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>Worm</td>
                    <td>A worm is like a virus, but it can spread to other computers without the user having to do anything.</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>Botnet</td>
                    <td>A botnet is a network of infected computers that are used to carry out DDoS or other attacks.</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>Rootkit</td>
                    <td>A rootkit is a piece of malware that can hide itself from the operating system and can be used to gain unauthorised access to a computer system.</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>Spyware</td>
                    <td>Spyware is a piece of malware that can monitor and record the activities of a user's computer.</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>Ransomware</td>
                    <td>Ransomware is a piece of malware that encrypts a user's files and demands payment in exchange for the decryption key.</td>
                  </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
        </p>
        <h3>Denial of Service Attacks</h3>
        <p>
            - A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is a type of attack that 
            disrupts a computer system by flooding it with requests, 
            causing it to become unresponsive or crash.<br>
            - The distributed (DDoS) version of this attack is where instead of just using 
            one or a few computers to carry out the attack, which is easier to block, the 
            attackers use a large number of computers (oftentimes on a botnet) to 
            carry out the attack.<br>
            - The attackers sometimes request payment to stop the attack.
        </p>
        <h3>Brute Force Attacks</h3>
        <p>
            - A Brute Force attack is a type of attack that 
            tries to guess a password by trying every possible combination 
            until it finds the correct one.<br>
            - Oftentimes this is done by using a dictionary of common passwords 
            first, and then using a brute force attack to try to guess the remaining 
            passwords (or just password if you're targeting someone specifically).<br>
            - Longer passwords and passwords with more types of characters take a lot 
            longer to iterate over than shorter ones, which is why many places will 
            force you to use a longer password with more types of characters.
        </p>
        <h3>Social Engineering Attacks</h3>
        <p>
            - A Social Engineering attack is a type of attack that 
            attempts to trick a person into divulging confidential information 
            or performing actions that they wouldn't normally do.<br>
            - Oftentimes this is done by pretending to be someone else, or by making it seem like 
            something has happened that hasn't (for example, a website pretending to be an official 
            warning from a company like Microsoft telling you you have a virus).<br>
            - The most common forms of social engineering are:
            <ul>
                <li>Phishing - where you pretend to be a reputable entity, and trick the user
                    into giving you their details.</li>
                <li>Pretexting - where you get sent a message pretending to be from a government 
                    or a company you worth for/with, and then tricks you into giving confidential
                    information.</li>
            </ul>
            - Social engineering is often a common component in other types of attacks, for example 
            downloading a trojan from an email from your 'bank'.<br>
            - It can be very effective because no matter how much you try to protect your computers, 
            you are always susceptible to human error.
        </p>
        <h3>SQL Injection Attacks</h3>
        <p>
            - A SQL Injection attack is a type of attack that  attempts to insert malicious SQL code 
            into a frontend (like a website) to gain unauthorised access to the database.
            <h4>uhh... but what is SQL?</h4>
            <p>
                - SQL stands for Structured Query Language, and is a language used to interact with 
                databases. It is a very powerful language, and is used to create, update, and delete 
                data in a database. It is also used to query the data in the database, and to perform 
                other tasks such as creating views and stored procedures.<br>
                - There are many types of SQL commands, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, 
                CREATE, ALTER, and DROP. If a database input (such as on a login page) is not 
                'sanitised' properly, it can be used to perform SQL injection attacks.<br>
                <sub>
                    SQL is either pronounced 'sequel' or ess queue ell. Under NO circumstances 
                    is it 'squeal'.
                </sub>
            </p>
        </p>
        <h3>Data Interception Attacks</h3>
        <p>
            - A Data Interception attack is a type of attack that attempts to steal data from a 
            system by intercepting and reading the data being sent between the system and the user.<br>
            - Oftentimes this is done by using a tool called a sniffer, which is a piece of software 
            that captures all the data being sent between the system and the user, and then displays 
            it to the attacker.
        </p>
        <h2>Methods of preventing attacks</h2>
        <p>
            - There are many methods of preventing attacks, but some common ones are:
            <!--This seems way too arbitrary to me, why not explain 2FA and shit?-->
            <ul>
                <li>Firewalls</li>
                <li>Passwords</li>
                <li>Encryption</li>
                <li>User access levels</li>
                <li>Penetration testing</li>
                <li>Physical security</li>
                <li>Antimalware/antivirus software</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Firewalls</h3>
        <p>
            - A firewall is a piece of software that allows you to control what traffic 
            can pass through it, and what it can block. It blocks unwanted traffic by 
            filtering requests and responses.<br>
            - Often both your router and your computer will have firewalls, sometimes 
            even your <a href="https://quad9.net">DNS has a firewall</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Passwords</h3>
        <p>
            - Passwords are a way of protecting your data, and are used to prevent 
            unauthorised access to your computer. They are usually stored in a database, 
            and are hashed using a one-way function (such as SHA-256) to make them 
            difficult to reverse engineer.<br>
            - These help prevent data theft and brute force attacks.
        </p>
        <h3>Encryption</h3>
        <p>
            - Encryption is a way of protecting your data, and is used to prevent 
            unauthorised access to your computer. It is done by using a one-way function 
            (such as AES) to encrypt your data, and then decrypting it using a key.
        </p>
        <h3>User access levels</h3>
        <p>
            - User access levels ensure that no one has higher access than they absolutely need.<br>
            - For example, in a company, an IT administrator account might have access to everything, but 
            a sales account might only have access to sales data.<br>
            - This prevents data theft, and can lessen the impact of a social engineering attack.
        </p>
        <h3>Penetration testing</h3>
        <p>
            - Penetration testing is a way of testing your computer for vulnerabilities.<br>
            - It is carried out by using both a tool called a vulnerability scanner, which 
            scans your computer for known vulnerabilities.<br>
            - Penetration testing is also done by people (sometimes known as 'ethical hackers') 
            who act like malicious hackers, and when they find a vulnerability, 
            they report it to you. Sometimes these people are employed by companies, and sometimes 
            bugs are reported through a 'bug bounty' program.<br>
            - This can prevent SQL injection, make social engineering attacks harder, and lets 
            attack vectors be found and fixed before they are exploited.
        <h3>Physical security</h3>
        <p>
            - Physical security is simply preventing physical access to a part of a network.<br>
            - For example, having a keycard system for access to a server room, CCTV, or simply 
            security by obscurity.<br>
            - This prevents data interception and theft, and can prevent social engineering attacks.
        </p>
        <h3>Antimalware/antivirus software</h3>
        <p>
            - Antimalware/antivirus software is a way of protecting your data, and is used to prevent 
            unauthorised access to your computer. It is done by using a tool called a 
            antivirus software, which scans for malware and then reports it to you.<br>
            - Antimalware software can be used to scan emails, files, websites etc.<br>
            - It works because it has a list of known malware signatures, and if even 
            if a program is not on the list, if it behaves suspiciously it can be flagged 
            (hence false positives).<br>
            - Antimalware software is used to stop... well, malware.
