        <h2>Operating Systems</h2>
        <p>
            - An operating system (OS) is a piece of software that provides an
            interface (I/O) between the use and the hardware in a computer system.<br>
            - An OS deliberately hides the inner workings of a computer from the
            user, in order to make it easier to use. For example, the user doesn't
            need to know the memory address of a running program, so it won't
            show that unless explicitly requested.<br>
            - An OS has 5 main functions: Providing a user interface (UI), managing
            memory and the CPU, managing peripherals and the device drivers
            (drivers let the OS interact with hardware), managing users
            (user accounts), and managing files.
        </p>
        <h3>Memory and CPU management</h3>
        <p>
            - Memory management is the process where the OS allocates (sections off)
            RAM between different programs that are open at the same time.<br>
            - The RAM is allocated based on priority and usage. A program with
            higher RAM usage will be allocated more RAM
            (as programs can have significantly different resource requirements),
            and a program actively in use by the user will get higher RAM
            allocation priority than a background application, who may have
            its data demoted to virtual memory.<br>
            - The OS dynamically manages the memory, so no program is allocated
            lots more memory than it needs.<br>
            - Memory management makes multitasking possible.
        </p>
