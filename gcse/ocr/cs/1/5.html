        <h1>Systems Software</h1>
        <i>Made using primarily the spec and my prior knowledge,
            with a bit of SaveMyExams.

        <h2>Operating Systems</h2>
        <p>
            - An operating system (OS) is a piece of software that provides an
            interface (I/O) between the use and the hardware in a computer system.<br>
            - An OS deliberately hides the inner workings of a computer from the
            user, in order to make it easier to use. For example, the user doesn't
            need to know the memory address of a running program, so it won't
            show that unless explicitly requested.<br>
            - An OS has 5 main functions: Providing a user interface (UI), managing
            memory and the CPU, managing peripherals and the device drivers
            (drivers let the OS interact with hardware), managing users
            (user accounts), and managing files.
        </p>
        <h3>Memory and CPU management</h3>
        <p>
            - Memory management is the process where the OS allocates (sections off)
            RAM between different programs that are open at the same time.<br>
            - The RAM is allocated based on priority and usage. A program with
            higher RAM usage will be allocated more RAM
            (as programs can have significantly different resource requirements),
            and a program actively in use by the user will get higher RAM
            allocation priority than a background application, who may have
            its data demoted to virtual memory.<br>
            - The OS dynamically manages the memory, so no program is allocated
            lots more memory than it needs.<br>
            - Memory management makes multitasking possible.
        </p>
        <h4>How multitasking is made possible</h4>
        <p>
            - 'Multitasking', in the computational sense, is when the OS is 
            simultaneously managing system resources to make the user 
            feel like they are using multiple programs at the same time.<br>
            - The OS splits tasks and allocates system resources to achieve 
            this.<br>
            - Since a CPU can only execute one instruction at a time, but 
            it can execute many instructions at high speed, the system is able 
            to constantly switch between programs in order to maintain 
            responsiveness.
        </p>
        <h3>User Interfaces</h3>
        <p>
            - A user interfact, or UI, is how a user interacts with the 
            operating system.<br>
            - The most common UIs include a Command Line Interface (CLI), 
            a Graphical User Interface (GUI), or a Mobile UI.
        </p>
        <h4>Command Line Interfaces</h4>
        <p>
            A CLI uses text-based commands to interact with the user. 
            advanced users are a lot more likely to use a CLI 
            (like me writing this lmao) and examples of CLIs are MS-DOS
            (officially Microsoft Disk Operating System, 
            but the original DOS was QDOS, or.. uh... 
            'Quick and Dirty Operating System'), and Windows Command 
            Processor (cmd.exe). 
        </p>
        <h4>Graphical User Interfaces</h4>
        <p>
            A GUI uses Windows, Icons, Menus and Pointers (WIMP) to 
            interact with the user. You're probably using one right now, 
            and examples include the Desktop Environments of 
            Windows, MacOS, Ubuntu, and many more.
        </p>
        <h4>Mobile User Interfaces</h4>
        <p>
            Mobile UIs are basically GUIs but optimised for mobile. 
            They respond to touch input, rather than needing a mouse 
            to use them.
        </p>
        <h3>Peripherals and Device Drivers</h3>
        <p>
            Peripheral management is defined as the process (carried 
            out by the Operating System) which manages the way peripherals 
            (like a mouse or speaker) interaccts with software. It allocates 
            resources to them, and manages them (which makes plug-and-play) 
            possible, so your computer automatically detects peripherals 
            and configures them without (much) user input.
