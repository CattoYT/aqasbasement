        <h1>1.5 - Systems Software</h1>
        <i>Made using primarily the spec and my prior knowledge,
            with a bit of SaveMyExams.
        </i>
        <h2>Operating Systems</h2>
        <p>
            - An operating system (OS) is a piece of software that provides an
            interface (I/O) between the use and the hardware in a computer system.<br>
            - An OS deliberately hides the inner workings of a computer from the
            user, in order to make it easier to use. For example, the user doesn't
            need to know the memory address of a running program, so it won't
            show that unless explicitly requested.<br>
            - An OS has 5 main functions: Providing a user interface (UI), managing
            memory and the CPU, managing peripherals and the device drivers
            (drivers let the OS interact with hardware), managing users
            (user accounts), and managing files.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Memory and CPU management</h3>
        <p>
            - Memory management is the process where the OS allocates (sections off)
            RAM between different programs that are open at the same time.<br>
            - The RAM is allocated based on priority and usage. A program with
            higher RAM usage will be allocated more RAM
            (as programs can have significantly different resource requirements),
            and a program actively in use by the user will get higher RAM
            allocation priority than a background application, who may have
            its data demoted to virtual memory.<br>
            - The OS dynamically manages the memory, so no program is allocated
            lots more memory than it needs.<br>
            - Memory management makes multitasking possible.
        </p>
        <h4>How multitasking is made possible</h4>
        <p>
            - 'Multitasking', in the computational sense, is when the OS is 
            simultaneously managing system resources to make the user 
            feel like they are using multiple programs at the same time.<br>
            - The OS splits tasks and allocates system resources to achieve 
            this.<br>
            - Since a CPU can only execute one instruction at a time, but 
            it can execute many instructions at high speed, the system is able 
            to constantly switch between programs in order to maintain 
            responsiveness.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>User Interfaces</h3>
        <p>
            - A user interface, or UI, is how a user interacts with the 
            operating system.<br>
            - The most common UIs include a Command Line Interface (CLI), 
            a Graphical User Interface (GUI), or a Mobile UI.
        </p>
        <h4>Command Line Interfaces</h4>
        <p>
            A CLI uses text-based commands to interact with the user. 
            advanced users are a lot more likely to use a CLI 
            (like me writing this lmao) and examples of CLIs are MS-DOS
            (officially Microsoft Disk Operating System, 
            but the original DOS was QDOS, or.. uh... 
            'Quick and Dirty Operating System'), and Windows Command 
            Processor (cmd.exe). 
        </p>
        <h4>Graphical User Interfaces</h4>
        <p>
            A GUI uses Windows, Icons, Menus and Pointers (WIMP) to 
            interact with the user. You're probably using one right now, 
            and examples include the Desktop Environments of 
            Windows, MacOS, Ubuntu, and many more.
        </p>
        <h4>Mobile User Interfaces</h4>
        <p>
            Mobile UIs are basically GUIs but optimised for mobile. 
            They respond to touch input, rather than needing a mouse 
            to use them.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Peripherals</h3>
        <p>
            Peripheral management is defined as the process (carried 
            out by the Operating System) which manages the way peripherals 
            (like a mouse or speaker) interacts with software. It allocates 
            resources to them, and manages them (which makes plug-and-play) 
            possible, so your computer automatically detects peripherals 
            and configures them without (much) user input.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Device Drivers</h3>
        <p>
            A device driver is a piece of software that is used to control a 
            piece of hardware. Peripherals (and any hardware) require device 
            drivers in order to be used with the OS, but the OS will have 
            generic device drivers built in which are designed to enable 
            basic compatibility with as many devices as possible of that type 
            and enables PnP (plug-and-play). If a device requires specific 
            features not present in the generic driver, a separate driver 
            must be installed, which can usually be downloaded from the 
            manufacturer. Drivers are OS specific, and receive updates for 
            as long as the device is supported.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>User Management</h3>
        <p>
            - User management is the process that an OS carries out to 
            allow different users to log onto a computer (user accounts).<br>
            - The OS will let each user have different settings, and permissions 
            (access rights) to access resources.<br>
            - A user can have administrator rights, which gives them the ability 
            to manage other users and permissions.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>File Management</h3>
        <p>
            - File management is where the OS creates, organises, manipulates and 
            accesses files and folders on a computer system.<br>
            - The OS manages the physical location of data on both primary and 
            secondary storage.<br>
            - File management gives the user the ability to create, name, rename, 
            copy, move, and delete files and folders.<br>
            - Permissions is also a part of file management, so based on user 
            permissions they may not be able to do (any number) of those tasks 
            with files/folders (see image below).<br>
            - The OS may provide a search function to find files (tags, folders, 
            file types, file content, etc.)

        <h2>Utility Software</h2>
        <p>
            - Utility software is software designed to help maintain, troubleshoot (or repair), 
           or enhance operation of, a computer system.<br>
            - Utility software is designed top perform specific tasks, and interacts with 
            hardware, for example an SSD (for a disk cleanup utility or something).<br>
            - Utility software comes installed with the operating system and is often crucial 
            to its functioning.<br>
            - There are three types of utility software you need to know about: defragmentation, 
            compression and encryption, but since you also need something for troubleshooting 
            task managers also come up a bit.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Defragmentation</h3>
        <p>
            - Defragmentation is part of the maintain category of utility software, and its 
            purpose is to group fragmented files (where files are spread out all over the 
            physical spinning platter of a magnetic drive), back together to speed up access times.<br>
            - As data is deleted over time, gaps are left on a drive and as new data fills 
            these gaps data gets fragmented.<br>
            - It's important to note that defragmentation <b>does not</b> help an SSD.<br>
            - Honestly I'm not sure how well I can explain this so go watch 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSvOfu2PfXk">this video</a> if you're stuck.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Compression</h3>
        <p>
            - This is explained in <a href="2_2.html">1.2_2</a>, so I'll keep it brief, 
            but compression (enhance) reduces the amount of secondary storage space required 
            by performing an algorithm on the original data.<br>
            - Lossy compression removes data from the original data, so the original file cannot be 
            recovered from the compressed version, but lossless compression just represents data 
            more efficiently, so the original files can be recreated.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Encryption</h3>
        <p>
            - Encryption (enhance) is where data is scrambled, using an algorithm from plain text 
            into cipher text, so that only someone with the 'key' can access it.<br>
            - Encryption software enhances security and keeps data safe from attackers.<br>
            - For example, encryption is used to store passwords.<br>
            - As an example of what it looks like, by using the AES-256 encryption standard 
            'AQA's Basement' becomes 'Iba1CyzG+i7g+kZxOVpnvw==' when using the key 'cs'.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Task Manager</h3>
        <p>
            - A task manager is a software that is built into the OS to allow a user to monitor 
            system resources and start/kill programs 'tasks' for troubleshooting.<br>
            - A task manager gives the user info such as processes, performance, 
            startup apps, users, system services, resource utilisation, and more.<br>
            - In Windows, the Task Manager is accessible by searching for <code>taskmgr.exe</code>, 
            or in Linux (or MacOS) you can run <code>top</code> from the terminal (CLI).
