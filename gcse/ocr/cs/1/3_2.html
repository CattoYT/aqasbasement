        <h2>Wired vs Wireless</h2>
        <!--Supermaven generated most of this in like 2 seconds how the hell did it do that-->
        <p>
            - Wired connections are physical cables that connect two devices together.<br>
            - Wired connections are generally more reliable and faster than wireless connections, but wireless
            connections are more secure and can be used over longer distances.<br>
            - The most common type of wired connection is the twisted pair cable, explained in 3_1, and Ethernet is
            the most common use of twisted pair cables for LANs, as it is standardised and well-supported.<br>
            - Ethernet can send and receive data simultaneously, through each pair of wires, at speeds of up to
            (most commonly) 10 Gbps (gigabits per second).<br>
            - Wireless connections are a type of network connection that uses radio waves to transmit data
            between devices.<br>
            - Wireless connections use radio waves to transmit data, and
            are more flexible and can be used in more situations.<br>
            - Wireless connections can be used in places where wired connections are not possible, such as
            in the open air, or in areas with poor or no coverage.

        <h3>Types of Wireless Connections</h3>
        <p>
            - For GCSE, you need to know about WiFi and Bluetooth.<br>
            - WiFi, Wireless Fidelity, or 802.11, is a very common standard for wireless connections, and is most
            common to connect to devices such as laptops, smartphones, tablets, and TVs.<br>
            - Clients using WiFi connect to a Wireless Access Point (WAP), which can be its own thing but is
            most commonly part of a router.<br>
            - Bluetooth is another standard for wireless connections, and is used for connecting devices together, such
            as a laptop and a mouse.<br>
            - It is much less commonly used for internet connections than WiFi.<br>
            - Bluetooth is only typically used for a connection between just two devices.

        <h2>Encryption</h2>
        <p>
            - Encryption is the process of converting data into a code that can only be read by someone with the
            correct key.<br>
            - Encryption is used to protect data from being read by unauthorised parties.<br>
            - Encryption is important on both wired and wireless networks, but it is needed more on wireless networks 
            due to man-in-the-middle attacks where someone can pretend to be the router and intercept data.<br>
            - Encryption is used to protect data in transit, and is also used to protect data at rest.
        </p>
        <h3>How is data encrypted?</h3>
        <p>
            - Encryption is done using a key, which is a piece of data that is used to encrypt the data.<br>
            - The key is used to encrypt the data, and the encrypted data is sent to the recipient.<br>
            - The key is kept secret, and only the recipient has the key to decrypt the data.<br>
            - Encryption is done using a specific algorithm, which is a set of rules that define how the data is encrypted.
        </p>
        <h3>Types of Encryption</h3>
        <p>
            - Symmetric encryption is where the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt the data.<br>
            - Asymmetric encryption is a different key is used to encrypt than to decrypt the data. This is also known as
            public key cryptography, and is what your computer is using to visit this website (assuming HTTPS, the 'S' 
            stands for 'Secure').<br>
            - Hashing is a type of encryption where the data is converted into a fixed-length string of characters, which
            is called a hash.<br>
            - Hashing is used to verify the integrity of the data, and is also used to create digital signatures.
        </p>
        <h3>Encryption on wireless networks</h3>
        <p>
            - Encryption on wireless networks is done using WPA2/WPA3, however older standards like the original 
            WAP still exist.<br>
            - When your computer connects to a wireless network, it will ask you for a password. This password is used, 
            along with the network's SSID ('Service Set Identifier', or the network name), to encrypt the data by 
            turning it into 'ciphertext' and back out again.<br>
            - The master key is sent to any device able to provide the correct password.<br>
            - The lack of encryption is the reason unsecured networks (ones without a password) are dangerous to use
            without another encryption standard. For websites this is TLS (Transport Layer Security) over HTTPS (although 
            many websites that require you to enter passwords force you to use HTTPS to stay compliant with data protection laws).<br>
            - Encryption on wireless networks is used to protect the data from being intercepted by someone who is
            not the owner of the network, and is also used to protect the data from being read by someone who is not
            the owner of the network.
        </p>
        <h3>Encryption on wired networks</h3>
        <p>
            - Encryption on wired networks is done using WEP, which works in a similar way to WPA2/WPA3.<br>
            - It is a weaker standard than WPA2/WPA3, and so WEP should not be used for wireless networks which are 
            easier to intercept.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>IP addresses and MAC addresses</h2>
        <p>
            - IP and MAC addresses are used to identify devices on a network, and are used to route data between devices 
            on a network.
        </p>
        <h3>IP addresses</h3>
        <p>
            - An IP address is a unique identifier for a device on a network.<br>
            - It is used to route data between devices on a network.<br>
            - It stands for 'Internet Protocol Address', and there are both internal and external IP addresses.<br>
            - An external IP address is the IP address that is visible to the internet, and is used to connect to 
            websites and other services.<br>
            - An internal IP address is the IP address that is used to connect to devices on the same network, and is 
            used to connect to services on the same network.
        </p>
        <h4>IPv4 vs IPv6</h4>
        <p>
            - IPv4 is the older commonly used IP address version.<br>
            - In IPv4, addresses are represented as a series of numbers separated by full stops, for example 
            <a href="http://81.0.246.142">81.0.246.142</a>. They are 1 byte (8 bits) per block, so 32 bits overall.<br>
            - IPv4 requires internal IP addresses due to there not being enough addresses for each computer to have its 
            own external IP address. This works through NAT (Network Address Translation), which is a process where 
            the router translates the internal IP address to an external IP address, and the external IP address is 
            visible to the internet.<br>
            - IPv6 is the newer commonly used IP address version.<br>
            - In IPv6, addresses are represented as a series of numbers separated by colons, for example 
            <a href="http://[2a02:c204:2208:8374::1]">2a02:c204:2208:8374::1</a>.<br>
            - IPv6 is needed due to there only being 4.3 billion IPv4 addresses available, which we ran out of 
            in November 2019 (at least for RIPE NCC, who are the organisation that manages IP addresses for Europe, the 
            Middle East and Central Asia. They were the last regional registry to run out.)<br>
            and so the number of IPv6 addresses is much higher (2^128 addresses, or, uh, 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456.)<br>
            - If you get asked for an IPv6 in an exam, you may write '::1' which is simply the loopback address, which is 
            the address of the computer itself, or an alias for 'localhost'.<br>
            - IPv6 addresses are varying length because ':0000:' can be compressed to just :: as many times over as needed, 
            but only once per address (for example, 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 is the same as 
            2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334, but if you had 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0000:7333 you couldn't 
            compress it to 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e::7333, just 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0:7334). Consecutive 0s can be compressed 
            to just one 0.<br><br>
            <b>
                If you are struggling to understand this, that's totally fair and don't stress about it too much, just remember 
                ::1 is valid in case it comes up and remember that this is only a small part of the overall paper 1. Feel 
                free to skip this section.
            </b><br><br>
            
        </p>
        <h3>MAC addresses</h3>
        <p>
            - A MAC address ('Media Access Control Address') is a unique identifier for a device on a LAN.<br>
            - A MAC address is static, and one is usually assigned to a NIC at the factory and doesn't change 
            no matter what network it's on.<br>
            - A MAC address is 12 hexademical digits (48 bits), grouped into pairs for readability. The first 
            three pairs are the Organisation Unique Identifier (OUI), which is a unique identifier for the manufacturer 
            of the device. The last three pairs are the Device Identifier, which is a unique identifier for the 
            device itself.<br>
            - There are 281 trillion MAC addresses.
