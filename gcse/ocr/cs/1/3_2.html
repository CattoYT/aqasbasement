        <h2>Wired vs Wireless</h2>
        <!--Supermaven generated most of this in like 2 seconds how the hell did it do that-->
        <p>
            - Wired connections are physical cables that connect two devices together.<br>
            - Wired connections are generally more reliable and faster than wireless connections, but wireless
            connections are more secure and can be used over longer distances.<br>
            - The most common type of wired connection is the twisted pair cable, explained in 3_1, and Ethernet is
            the most common use of twisted pair cables for LANs, as it is standardised and well-supported.<br>
            - Ethernet can send and receive data simultaneously, through each pair of wires, at speeds of up to
            (most commonly) 10 Gbps (gigabits per second).<br>
            - Wireless connections are a type of network connection that uses radio waves to transmit data
            between devices.<br>
            - Wireless connections use radio waves to transmit data, and
            are more flexible and can be used in more situations.<br>
            - Wireless connections can be used in places where wired connections are not possible, such as
            in the open air, or in areas with poor or no coverage.

        <h3>Types of Wireless Connections</h3>
        <p>
            - For GCSE, you need to know about WiFi and Bluetooth.<br>
            - WiFi, Wireless Fidelity, or 802.11, is a very common standard for wireless connections, and is most
            common to connect to devices such as laptops, smartphones, tablets, and TVs.<br>
            - Clients using WiFi connect to a Wireless Access Point (WAP), which can be its own thing but is
            most commonly part of a router.<br>
            - Bluetooth is another standard for wireless connections, and is used for connecting devices together, such
            as a laptop and a mouse.<br>
            - It is much less commonly used for internet connections than WiFi.<br>
            - Bluetooth is only typically used for a connection between just two devices.
