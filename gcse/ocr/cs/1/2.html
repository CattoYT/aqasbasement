            <h1>1.2 - Memory and Storage</h1>
            <h2>Primary Storage</h2>
            <p>
                - Primary storage is storage that is small in capacity, 
                generally volatile (except ROM), and is quick to access.<br>
                - It stores the data that your computer needs when turned on, 
                for example instructions or a program's settings file.<br>
                - It is required in a computer system because of its speed, 
                which reduces the time taken to complete operations 
                (such as the fetch-decode-execute cycle) significantly.<br>
                - It includes RAM, but also components like cache and registers.<br>
                - Primary storage is normally closer to the CPU, to reduce access latencies.<br>
                - It's usually a lot more expensive than secondary storage, 
                owing to its fast access times.<br>
                - ROM counts as primary storage, but it is not able to be overwritten easily, 
                hence its name (Read-Only Memory). 
                It is still fast and directly available to the system.<br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>RAM vs ROM</h2>
            <p>
                - RAM, or Random Access Memory, holds the data and instructions 
                that are currently being used.<br>
                - For the CPU to access the data on RAM, 
                it must first be copied across from secondary storage.<br>
                - As ram is volatile primary storage, it is very fast.<br>
                - It can be written to as well as read from.<br>
                - Normally has more storage than ROM.
            </p>
            <p>
                - ROM, or read only memory, is primary storage that holds 
                the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) and the boot 
                instructions.<br>
                - It's a small memory chip on the computer's motherboard.<br>
                - It's fast, slower than RAM but faster than secondary storage.<br>
                - It's non-volatile (not wiped when power is lost) storage type.<br>
                - ROM is read-only, and it has a very small capacity.
