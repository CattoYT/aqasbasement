            <h1>1.3 - Computer networks, connections and protocols (Part 1)</h1>
            <i>I already knew most of this, so it was mostly built directly following the spec.</i>
            <h2>Network Pros/Cons</h2>
            <p>
                - Networks are cruical to our modern use of computers, as the 
                largest network we have is the internet.<br>
                - They come with quite a lot of pros, for example users can share 
                resources (like printers and storage servers), access their 
                files from anywhere on the network, stay in touch through calls and 
                emails, store files in central databases,
                and back up their computers, but they also have cons.<br>
                - There are security risks with networks, since things like viruses 
                are most commonly distributed through them, and malware can take 
                over networks if not properly secured.<br>
                - Network traffic can also be intercepted, meaning a layer of 
                encryption (SSL) is required for sensitive information.<br>
                - Servers and network switches are single point of failure, 
                so your entire network can become useless if just one thing fails, 
                and lots of users and data can slow everything down and 
                make the experience of using the network worse.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Types of Networks</h2>
            <p>
                - Networks are split into two categories, LANs (Local Area Networks) 
                and WANs (Wide Area Networks).
            </p>
            <b>LANs</b>
            <p>
                - Local Area Networks are networks which are defined has having 
                a small geographical area of under 1 mile, and all of the hardware 
                is owned by the person/group of people using it.<br>
                - LANs use 'twister pair' (UTP, Ethernet) cables, fibre optical cables, 
                or Wi-Fi.
            </p>
            <b>WANs</b>
            <p>
                - Wide Area Networks have a large geographical area of over 1 mile.<br>
                - They are a collection of LANs joined together.<br>
                - The largest WAN is the internet.<br>
                - To connect to a WAN, you have to use a router.<br>
                - <b>Not</b> all the hardware used is owned by the person using it. 
                For example, your traffic will have to go through your ISP 
                (Internet Service Provider) at some point.<br>
                - WANs use fibre optic cables, satellites and telephone lines.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Network Performance</h2>
            <p>
                Network performance is affected by the bandwidth available, 
                the number of users on the network, the latency of connection 
                between computers, the error rate of signals, and the medium 
                (think: type of cable, Wi-Fi) of transmission.
            </p>
            <b>Bandwidth</b>
            <p>
                Bandwidth is the maximum amount of data that cant be sent 
                and received at one time. It is measured in bits per second 
                (bit rate) and a smaller bandwidth means less data can be 
                sent (a slower network), and a higher bandwidth means that 
                more data can be sent, resulting in a faster experience.
            </p>
            <b>Number of Users</b>
            <p>
                A higher number of users (users on a network at the same time) 
                can lead to slowdown if the servers managing the network 
                (like a router) cannot cope with the load or if there is not 
                enough bandwidth for everyone.
            </p>
            <b>Latency</b>
            <p>
                Latency is the delay between data being sent and received, 
                usually measured in milliseconds (ms). If there is high 
                latency, more data will be on the network at once so 
                more data will be on the network, causing collisions.
                This can lead to even more data being sent as the error 
                rate (how many packets of data do not reach their 
                destination) will increase. Error rate may also increase 
                on less reliable connections.<br>
                The experience is also worsened since the data takes more 
                time to arrive.
            </p>
            <b>Transmission Media</b>
            <p>
                Transmission media is the type of cable used for wired connections, 
                which are higher bandwidth and generally more stable than wireless. 
                The main options for wires are the unshielded twisted-pair (copper or 
                some other metal) cable (usually Ethernet) and fibre-optic cables. 
                Fibre-optic cables have a higher bandwidth than copper cables, 
                and faster transfer rates (2/3 the speed of light).
            </p>
            <h2>Network Models</h2>
            <p>
                - A network model is the logical structure of the network.<br>
                - It defines how the network digitally, will operate on top of the physical network.
            </p>
            <h3>Client-Server Models</h3>
            <p>
                - A client-server model is where there is a distinct client and a distinct 
                server on a network, and these connect via a network switch.<br>
                - The server is the device which often has a single purpose, like 
                managing internet access, serving files, controlling security, 
                managing a smart home, or providing a remote hub for updates.<br>
                - A server is sometimes more powerful than the clients, as 
                they often serve many many different client machines (think 
                about how many requests a web server has to deal with, for 
                example.)<br>
                - Servers may require specific hardware (like many CPU cores 
                to run many virtual machines), and specific software (like 
                the nginx ('engine x') web server software.)<br>
                - Most organisations will use a client-server model, as files 
                and permissions are easier to manage, and the org can more 
                easily upgrade things all at once.<br>
                - Servers can often be expensive however, require specialist 
                knowledge to operate, and act as single points of failure.
            </p>
            <h3>Peer to Peer (P2P) Model</h3>
            <p>
                - In a peer-to-peer model, every computer on a network is 
                equivalent to any other.<br>
                - Each peer is responsible for their own management, with 
                no central server to manage services collectively.<br>
                - Most homes have a P2P model, as 
                <i title="this definitely does not include me">most</i> 
                people do not need or want to run services centrally, or 
                do not have the prerequisite knowledge or funds.<br>
                - P2P models are very easy to setup, maintain, are cheap, 
                and no specialist knowledge is required.<br>
                - However, P2P networks can compromise security and reliability.
