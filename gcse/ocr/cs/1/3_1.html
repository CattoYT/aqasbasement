            <h1>1.3 - Computer networks, connections and protocols (Part 1)</h1>
            <i>I already knew most of this, so it was mostly built directly following the spec.</i>
            <h2>Types of Network</h2>
            <p>
                - There are two different types of networks: a LAN, or Local Area Network, 
                and WAN, or Wide Area Network.<br>
                - There are advantages and disadvantages to each type, but there are also 
                advantages and disadvantages to networks as a whole.
