            <h1>1.3 - Computer networks, connections and protocols (Part 1)</h1>
            <i>I already knew most of this, so it was mostly built directly following the spec.</i>
            <h2>Network Pros/Cons</h2>
            <p>
                - Networks are cruical to our modern use of computers, as the 
                largest network we have is the internet.<br>
                - They come with quite a lot of pros, for example users can share 
                resources (like printers and storage servers), access their 
                files from anywhere on the network, stay in touch through calls and 
                emails, store files in central databases,
                and back up their computers, but they also have cons.<br>
                - There are security risks with networks, since things like viruses 
                are most commonly distributed through them, and malware can take 
                over networks if not properly secured.<br>
                - Network traffic can also be intercepted, meaning a layer of 
                encryption (SSL) is required for sensitive information.<br>
                - Servers and network switches are single point of failure, 
                so your entire network can become useless if just one thing fails, 
                and lots of users and data can slow everything down and 
                make the experience of using the network worse.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Types of Networks</h2>
            <p>
                - Networks are split into two categories, LANs (Local Area Networks) 
                and WANs (Wide Area Networks).
            </p>
            <b>LANs</b>
            <p>
                - Local Area Networks are networks which are defined has having 
                a small geographical area of under 1 mile, and all of the hardware 
                is owned by the person/group of people using it.<br>
                - LANs use 'twister pair' (UTP, Ethernet) cables, fibre optical cables, 
                or Wi-Fi.
            </p>
            <b>WANs</b>
            <p>
                - Wide Area Netowrks have a large geographical area of over 1 mile.<br>
                - They are a collection of LANs joined together.<br>
                - The largest WAN is the internet.<br>
                - To connect to a WAN, you have to use a router.<br>
                - <b>Not</b> all the hardware used is owned by the person using it. 
                For example, your traffic will have to go through your ISP 
                (Internet Service Provider) at some point.<br>
                - WANs use fibre optic cables, satellites and telephone lines.
