            <h1>1.2 - Memory and Storage (Part 2)</h1>
            <i>this page was mostly built following the course on savemyexams, but I added quite a lot</i>
            <h2>Units of Data</h2>
            <p>
                - Computers use 1s and 0s (binary digits, bits) to represent information.<br>
                - A byte is 8 bits, as this is what you need to represent a character in binary with ASCII, 
                or the American Standard Code for Information Interchange.<br>
                - Interestingly, a nibble is 4 bits or half a byte.<br>
                - Modern systems mainly use a different character system called Unicode, 
                but the byte as 8 bits stuck.
            </p>
            <p>
                B: Byte<br>
                KB: Kilobyte (1000 bytes)<br>
                MB: Megabyte (1,000,000 bytes)<br>
                And so on according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix">SI prefixes</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to this, a lowercase 'b' indicates bits, and an i (as in MiB), 
                indicates x1024. So 1KiB = 1,024B, 1MiB = 1,048,576B, but 1 Mb is only 0.125MiB.<br>
                (at GCSE [x]iB doesn't matter, so you may ignore this.)
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Reading data from a disk/disc</h2>
            <p>
                - The reason computers use binary is that they consist of billions (at least modern ones anyway) 
                of tiny switches called transistors. Switches are either on or off, therefore computers must use a 
                numbering system that it either on or off (1 or 0): binary.<br>
                - This means that all data entering a computer system must be converted to binary before it can be 
                processed.<br>
                - This also means that storage devices use binary. 
                In optical discs, it is represented by a land (higher) or pit (lower), 
                in magnetic media, it is represented by positive or negative magnetic polarity, 
                and in solid state media it is represented by 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/EXLfErPEYiw?t=529">the presence of electrons in a floating gate 
                or charge trap layer</a>.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Capacity Requirements</h2>
            <p>
                - Data capacity is the max amount of data a storage device can hold.<br>
                - By knowing the capacity of a storage device, and how the size of a 
                type of data scales with length, you can calculate how much of different 
                data types can be stored.<br>
                - Data types can include text, basic streams of bytes, sound files, any file format really.
            </p>
            <p>
                - You calculate capacity requirements by doing capacity/size of file.<br>
                - For text files, you do bytes per character * number of characters to get file size.<br>
                - For image files, you do resolution (like 1920x1080, so 2,073,600) * colour depth (usually 24 bits).<br>
                - For sound files, you do sample rate * duration * bit depth.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Representing Characters</h2>
            <p><i>This was alluded to before</i></p>
            <p>
                - Computers have to represent all data in binary, and this includes keyboard input characters.<br>
                - The more binary digits you use to represent characters, 
                the more characters you can represent but the more bits are taken up.<br>
                - Computers use character sets for characters, which is a 
                'defined list of characters that can be understood by a computer'.<br>
                - Each character is given a binary code, and sets are ordered logically 
                (e.g. in ASCII 00110000 is 0, while 00110001 is 1).<br>
                - A character set provides a standard for computers to send/receive text.
            </p>
            <p>
                - The most common character sets are ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) 
                and Unicode (Universal Character Encoding).<br>
                - As you might guess, ASCII only contains English characters 
                (and some numbers and special characters), 
                which makes sense since it's an American standard but is a bit short-sighted.<br>
                - With Unicode, instead, the goal is to represent <b>every character ever used</b> 
                and more and more gets added to it with every revision.<br>
                - It uses a minimum of 16 bits, providing 65,536 possible characters.

            <h2>Representing Sound</h2>
            <p>
                - For sound to be represented as binary so computers can process it, it must first be sampled and stored.<br>
                - To do this, when a microphone records it is actually recording measurements of the original sound wave 
                and then are stored as binary on secondary storage.<br>
                - Sound waves are analogue (meaning a continuous wave), but computers can only work with digital data.<br>
                - The process of conversion is simply called 'Analogue to Digital', or A2D.
            </p>
            <p>
                To convert sound waves, the computer:<br>
                1. Measures the amplitude of the analogue sound wave, creating samples.<br>
                2. Generates binary values from the samples.<br>
                3. Creates a digital version of the sound wave from the samples.<br>
                Then, to play back the audio, the computer reverses the process, converting digital to analogue for speakers.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you still remember what I said in the 'Capacity Requirements' section, you may now be wondering where 
                'sample rate' and 'bit depth' come in to this.<br>
                - Sample rate is the amount of samples taken per second (Hz) of an analogue sound wave.<br>
                - The higher the sample rate, the less blocky the sound wave looks and the more the sound will 
                sound true to the original:
            </p>
            <img class="centreimage" src="../../../../images/cs/signals.png">
            <p><i><a href="https://ocw.cs.pub.ro/courses/iot/courses/02">image source</a>, licensed under CC-BY-SA</i></p>
            <p>
                Landline telephones use 16/22kHz sample rates, CDs use 44.1kHz, and DVDs use 48kHz.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Bit Depth</b> is the number of bits stored per sample of sound. It being higher means 
                a bigger range of sounds can be represented, and it has better sound quality, but it 
                results in a larger file size.
