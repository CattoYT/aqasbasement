            <h2>Units of Data</h2>
            <p>
                - Computers use 1s and 0s (binary digits, bits) to represent information.<br>
                - A byte is 8 bits, as this is what you need to represent a character in binary with ASCII, 
                or the American Standard Code for Information Interchange.<br>
                - Interestingly, a nibble is 4 bits or half a byte.<br>
                - Modern systems mainly use a different character system called Unicode, 
                but the byte as 8 bits stuck.
            </p>
            <p>
                B: Byte<br>
                KB: Kilobyte (1000 bytes)<br>
                MB: Megabyte (1,000,000 bytes)<br>
                And so on according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix">SI prefixes</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to this, a lowercase 'b' indicates bits, and an i (as in MiB), 
                indicates x1024. So 1KiB = 1,024B, 1MiB = 1,048,576B, but 1 Mb is only 0.125MiB.<br>
                (at GCSE [x]iB doesn't matter, so you may ignore this.)
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Reading data from a disk/disc</h2>
            <p>
                - The reason computers use binary is that they consist of billions (at least modern ones anyway) 
                of tiny switches called transistors. Switches are either on or off, therefore computers must use a 
                numbering system that it either on or off (1 or 0): binary.<br>
                - This means that all data entering a computer system must be converted to binary before it can be 
                processed.<br>
                - This also means that storage devices use binary. 
                In optical discs, it is represented by a land (higher) or pit (lower), 
                in magnetic media, it is represented by positive or negative magnetic polarity, 
                and in solid state media it is represented by 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/EXLfErPEYiw?t=529">the presence of electrons in a floating gate 
                or charge trap layer</a>.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Capacity Requirements</h2>
            <p>
                - Data capacity is the max amount of data a storage device can hold.<br>
                - By knowing the capacity of a storage device, and how the size of a 
                type of data scales with length, you can calculate how much of different 
                data types can be stored.<br>
                - Data types can include text, basic streams of bytes, sound files, any file format really.
            </p>
            <p>
                - You calculate capacity requirements by doing capacity/size of file.<br>
                - For text files, you do bytes per character * number of characters to get file size.<br>
                - For image files, you do resolution (like 1920x1080, so 2,073,600) * colour depth (usually 24 bits).<br>
                - For sound files, you do sample rate * duration * bit depth.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Binary (Base-2) and Denary (Base-10)</h2>
            <p>
                - In Denary, the number system you're likely to be used to, 
                each digit has a weight factor of 10 raised to a power, 
                so the units column is 10<sup>0</sup>, the next is 10<sup>1</sup>, 
                and so on.<br>
                - Because the system is base 10, there are 10 different digits in use: 
                0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. In Base 2, there is only 0 and 1 to 
                work with.
